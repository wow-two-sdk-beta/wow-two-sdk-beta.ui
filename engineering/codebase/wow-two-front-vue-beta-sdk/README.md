# @wow-two-beta/ui-vue

Vue 3 components, application adapters and browser capabilities for the wow-two ecosystem.
This beta package evolves independently of React. Pin an exact version when upgrading.

## Install

```bash
pnpm add @wow-two-beta/ui-vue vue
```

Vue is required. Install optional peers only for the entries you use:

| Entry                    | Optional peers                                                 |
| ------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `/router`                | `vue-router@^4`                                                |
| `/query`                 | `@tanstack/vue-query@^5.102.8`                                 |
| `/query/testing`         | `@tanstack/vue-query@^5.102.8`, `@vue/test-utils@^2.4.6`       |
| `/forms-engine/tanstack` | `@tanstack/vue-form@^1`                                        |
| `/styles.css` build      | `tailwindcss@^4.1` plus the application's Tailwind integration |

Core JavaScript entries and the house form adapter do not require these optional peers.
The manifest's `exports` map is the entry inventory; builds fail for missing source entries.

## Use

```vue
<script setup lang="ts">
import { Button } from '@wow-two-beta/ui-vue/presentation/actions';
import '@wow-two-beta/ui-vue/styles.css';
</script>

<template>
  <Button variant="solid" @click="save">Save</Button>
</template>
```

`styles.css` contains Tailwind 4 source directives; process it through the application's Tailwind build.
It registers the package's own utility classes, which Tailwind otherwise excludes inside `node_modules`.
`themes.css` contains generated theme tokens and `themes.json` their manifest.
Load the theme stylesheet when using a generated theme class.

The root exports presentation components and the `styles`, `dom`, `optionals`, `state`, `numbers`, `json`, `icons`, `primitives`, `themes`,
`color` and `emoji` namespaces. Dedicated subpaths expose application adapters:

```ts
import { createAppRouter } from '@wow-two-beta/ui-vue/router';
import { queryPlugin, useAppQuery } from '@wow-two-beta/ui-vue/query';
import { useAppForm } from '@wow-two-beta/ui-vue/forms-engine/house';
import { THEMES } from '@wow-two-beta/ui-vue/foundation/themes';
```

Use capability names `/foundation/formatters`, `/foundation/channels`, `/foundation/history`
and `/foundation/validators`. The retired `format`, `sync`, `undo` and `validation` entries are absent.

## Exact numbers and JSON

`foundation/numbers` exposes the immutable `ExactNumber` value/factory. Create values from decimal text
or `bigint`; native safe integers have an explicit factory. Native floating-point inputs cannot recover
precision already lost. Operations return the SDK `Result`:

```ts
import { ExactNumber, NumberRounding } from '@wow-two-beta/ui-vue/foundation/numbers';
import { LosslessJson } from '@wow-two-beta/ui-vue/foundation/json';
import { createApiClient } from '@wow-two-beta/ui-vue/foundation/http';

const left = ExactNumber.parse('0.1');
const right = ExactNumber.parse('0.2');
if (left.ok && right.ok) {
  const sum = left.value.add(right.value);
  if (sum.ok) console.log(sum.value.toString()); // '0.3'
}

const api = createApiClient({ json: LosslessJson });
```

The explicit HTTP codec handles incoming and outgoing numeric tokens without native JSON conversion.
All decoded JSON numbers are `ExactNumber`, including small integers; endpoint decoders validate their
shape and deliberately convert fields that need native integers. Existing clients retain their native
JSON behavior until configured with this codec. FormData bypasses JSON encoding.

Addition, subtraction, multiplication and truncating remainder are exact within the documented resource
budget. Division and rounding require `{ decimalPlaces, rounding: NumberRounding.HalfEven }` (or another
explicit mode). Use `equals`/`compare` for numeric comparison. JavaScript operators, `Math`, native
`JSON.stringify` and identity comparison do not implement custom numeric arithmetic. Numeric/default
coercion and native JSON serialization throw instead of silently approximating; `toApproximateNumber`
is the explicitly lossy conversion. Powers, roots and transcendental functions are not this API's scope.

`LosslessJson` preserves numeric token spelling on parse/write, including exponent notation and negative
zero. Arithmetic produces normalized tokens. It preserves ordinary strings and own object keys, rejects
duplicate decoded keys, and builds null-prototype records. Encoding rejects unsupported custom instances,
accessors, sparse arrays, circular references and native non-integer numbers instead of guessing or dropping
data. Encode domain values such as dates explicitly. `NumberLimits` and `JsonLimits` document centralized
resource budgets; exceeding them returns a failure rather than rounding, wrapping or truncating a value.

## Architecture

| Layer                | Responsibility                                                     |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `foundation/*`       | Primitives, infrastructure and browser capabilities                |
| `domain/*`           | Color and emoji models and operations                              |
| `presentation/*`     | Actions, display, feedback, forms, layout, navigation and overlays |
| Application adapters | Router, query, auth, feedback, forms, analytics and flags          |

ESLint enforces dependency direction. Foundation cannot import higher layers.
Application adapters have separate entries to scope optional vendor dependencies.

## Compatibility and verification

The package ships ESM and TypeScript declarations. Consumer checks use strict TypeScript with
`moduleResolution: Bundler` and `skipLibCheck: false`. CommonJS consumption is unsupported.

The sweep's local compatibility baseline is Node 20.10.0, Vue 3.5.41, TypeScript 5.9.3,
Vite 6.4.3, Tailwind 4.3.3 and Playwright 1.62.1. Optional-adapter checks use
Vue Router 4.6.4, Vue Query 5.102.8 and Vue Form 1.33.5. These are tested versions,
not evidence that every version accepted by a dependency range was tested.

Tests distinguish DOM-free imports, Node server rendering, happy-dom interaction and real Chromium behavior.
Chromium runs in ordinary and forced-colors modes. This does not establish hydration, browser or
assistive-technology coverage for every component.

Browser APIs remain subject to secure contexts, permissions and user activation. Read typed outcomes.
Give `LocaleProvider` the same request locale on server and client; its fallback is `en-US`.
Apply browser preferences explicitly after hydration.

## Develop

```bash
pnpm install --frozen-lockfile
pnpm exec playwright install chromium
pnpm typecheck
pnpm lint
pnpm format:check
pnpm test
pnpm build
pnpm check:package
pnpm check:package --install
```

`typecheck` runs `vue-tsc`, the capability import/cycle check and actual SFC compilation.
`check:package` validates the tarball's exports, runtime imports and strict public types in isolated core
and optional-adapter consumers. `--install` additionally installs the tarball and peers into a fresh npm project.
`--output /absolute/path/package.tgz` retains the exact verified artifact.

Tests live under `tests/`; examples live under `apps/`.
`pnpm playground` starts the playground; `pnpm dev` watches the library build.
Playground source aliases derive from the same public export manifest as the library build.

## Release

The repository's `release-vue` workflow validates, bumps the beta patch version, builds, checks the packed
consumer and publishes that verified tarball. Tags use `ui-vue-v`. React has an independent release.

## Public runtime support matrix

This matrix covers all **72 manifest export keys**: 68 JavaScript entries and four asset/metadata entries. Public paths below are relative to `@wow-two-beta/ui-vue`; `.` means the package root. The package gate imports/types **64 JavaScript entries without optional adapter peers**, then all **68 with the selected peers installed**, in Node without DOM globals. Those are import/declaration checks: they do not invoke every browser operation or prove component server rendering. The final release artifact must rerun `check:package` after source changes.

Verified baseline: Node **20.10.0**, Vue **3.5.41**, TypeScript **5.9.3**, ES2022 ESM build output, and Chromium **151.0.7922.34** with Playwright **1.62.1**. Chromium normal/forced-colors checks pass **30 tests across six project files**. Firefox and WebKit behavior is unverified; **no broader browser minimum is verified**. ES2022 is a compilation target, not evidence of browser API/CSS availability. Peer ranges describe install compatibility, not an assertion that every allowed version was tested. Optional adapters' tested versions appear above.

Server evidence labels: **fixtures** means only the named suite's concrete render cases, **import only** means no entry-wide server-render claim, and **asset** is not a JavaScript runtime entry. Pure operations can run in Node when their listed platform inputs exist; Vue hooks require their documented owning scope. Browser methods remain conditional on API presence, permission, secure context, user activation and host policy. Their declared Result/state/error contract governs unavailable APIs; this table does not turn every method into the same fallback.

### SSR, hydration and ownership limits

Node SSR fixtures create a fresh Vue app and call `renderToString` without DOM globals (`tests/support/Smoke.ts`). A successful fixture proves its selected props/slot/provider setup, not every branch, Teleport hydration or full request-resource cleanup. A separate locale probe checks two independent roots, provider replacement and deterministic happy-dom hydration even when browser language differs. No package-wide hydration guarantee is made. Portal/Teleport content requires the app's supported server/client composition; modal and focus behavior is accepted through browser tests, not Node render output.

Create mutable auth bridges, query clients, form engines, stores and buses per app/request. Share only immutable data or non-user formatting caches. Server code must explicitly release any resources it starts; client unmount hooks do not run after server rendering. Provider smoke tests do not establish that every arbitrary adapter supplied by a caller disposes correctly.

Focused lifecycle evidence includes auth strategy replacement/unmount and stale sign-in/out, query-client isolation and stale lazy-query reset/disposal, form reset/cancel/session invalidation, and locale root isolation. Passing real-browser focus-scope tests cover nested/portalled layers, owner documents, inert restoration and dismissal cleanup in ordinary and forced-colors Chromium. Representative public root-ref tests exercise native focus/measurement and unmount lifetime under happy-dom. This evidence does not establish geometry or keyboard acceptance for every component or browser.

`foundation/datetime` imports its declared Temporal implementation locally; it does not patch a global prototype. Apps using native Temporal elsewhere own that global/runtime policy. Feature-specific API availability must be checked at the operation boundary, even on the tested Chromium baseline. Stylesheet support and forced-colors/reduced-motion behavior are separate from JavaScript import support.
