// The sink seam — one small interface between the client and whatever actually ships the data
// (GA · PostHog · Segment · a console logger · a test double).
//
// Every method is OPTIONAL: a sink that only cares about events implements `track` and nothing else, and
// the client skips what is absent instead of making each adapter stub three no-ops. Methods may return a
// promise, but the client never awaits one on the hot path — `track` stays fire-and-forget, so a rejected
// promise is routed to `onError` exactly like a synchronous throw (see `Analytics.ts`). `flush` is the one
// call a consumer awaits, for page-unload and test drainage.
//
// `AnalyticsFailurePhase` reuses the `AnalyticsCallKind` values and adds `flush`, so a handler can switch
// over one vocabulary covering every place a third-party sink can fail.
