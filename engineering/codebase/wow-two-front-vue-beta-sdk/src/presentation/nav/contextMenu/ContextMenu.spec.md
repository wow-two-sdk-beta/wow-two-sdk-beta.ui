# ContextMenu

Renders only its slot, owning the open state and anchor point of the ContextMenu tree below.

Source: [ContextMenu.vue](ContextMenu.vue).

Public import: `import { ContextMenu } from '@wow-two-beta/ui-vue/presentation/nav';`.

## Contract

- Unmount disposes the subscriptions, listeners or timers registered by this implementation.
- Automatic attribute inheritance is disabled; the source explicitly forwards and merges supported fallthrough attributes.

## Props

No declared props.

## Emits

None declared.

## Slots

| Slot | Signature | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `default` | `default(): unknown` | See the declared signature. |

## Exposed handle

No explicit exposed handle.

## Verification

- Public render fixture: [NavExamples.ts](../../../../apps/playground/src/gallery/fixtures/NavExamples.ts). This covers render/SSR compatibility, not all interaction behavior.
- Required follow-through for changes: verify the affected state, keyboard, focus, composition and cleanup paths; the existence of this specification is not a passing-test claim.
