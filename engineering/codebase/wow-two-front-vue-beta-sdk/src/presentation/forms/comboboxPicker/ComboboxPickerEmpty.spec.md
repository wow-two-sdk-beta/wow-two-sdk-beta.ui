# ComboboxPickerEmpty

Renders the no-matches message as a disabled option row, perceivable to AT but skipped by keyboard nav.

Source: [ComboboxPickerEmpty.vue](ComboboxPickerEmpty.vue).

Public import: `import { ComboboxPickerEmpty } from '@wow-two-beta/ui-vue/presentation/forms';`.

## Contract

- Compose using the props, slots and events below. Preserve the rendered element’s native semantics and provide the required content/data.
- Automatic attribute inheritance is disabled; the source explicitly forwards and merges supported fallthrough attributes.

## Props

No declared props.

## Emits

None declared.

## Slots

| Slot | Signature | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `default` | `default(): unknown;` | The no-matches copy — the default slot. |

## Exposed handle

No explicit exposed handle.

## Verification

- Public render fixture: [FormsExamples.ts](../../../../apps/playground/src/gallery/fixtures/FormsExamples.ts). This covers render/SSR compatibility, not all interaction behavior.
- Required follow-through for changes: verify the affected state, keyboard, focus, composition and cleanup paths; the existence of this specification is not a passing-test claim.
