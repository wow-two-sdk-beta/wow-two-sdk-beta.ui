# PinInput

Renders a row of single-character PIN cells with auto-advance, paste-spread and backspace-to-previous.

Source: [PinInput.vue](PinInput.vue).

Public import: `import { PinInput } from '@wow-two-beta/ui-vue/presentation/forms';`.

## Contract

- Each controlled axis has one Vue model name and one update event. Primary values use `modelValue` / `update:modelValue`; disclosure uses `open` / `update:open`. Named axes use their declared `update:*` event. Defaults seed uncontrolled state once; external updates do not emit intent.
- Native form reset requests the original seed through the outer state owner. Nested controls reconcile without issuing their own default requests. Composite drafts remount from the resolved state. A cancelled reset changes nothing.

- The committed state uses the shared controlled-state helper: supplied controlled state is read from props; user changes report intent. The default seeds uncontrolled state. External prop updates do not themselves emit user changes.
- Automatic attribute inheritance is disabled; the source explicitly forwards and merges supported fallthrough attributes.

## Props

| Prop | Type | Required | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `length` | `number` | no | `6` | The number of digit cells. Default 6. |
| `modelValue` | `string` | no | — | The value, controlled (full string). The `v-model` binding target. |
| `defaultValue` | `string` | no | — | The uncontrolled initial value. |
| `type` | `PinInputType` | no | `PinInputType.Numeric` | The allowed characters — digits (`numeric`) or any single char (`alphanumeric`). Default `numeric`. |
| `size` | `Size` | no | `SizeValue.Md` | The cell visual size. Default `md`. |
| `isMasked` | `boolean` | no | `undefined` | The masked mode — renders each cell as `*` (good for verification codes). |
| `isDisabled` | `boolean` | no | `undefined` | The disabled state. Falls back to the surrounding form control's `isDisabled`. |

## Emits

| Event | Signature | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `update:modelValue` | `'update:modelValue': [value: string];` | Fires when the reader types, pastes or deletes a character — the `v-model` half. |
| `complete` | `complete: [value: string];` | Fires when the reader fills the final cell, carrying the complete code. |

## Slots

None declared.

## Exposed handle

`{ el: root }`. Read this through a component template ref after mount; the referenced DOM node may be absent while unmounted.

## Verification

- Reset regressions: [CompositeReset.dom.test.ts](../../../../tests/unit/presentation/forms/CompositeReset.dom.test.ts).

- Public render fixture: [FormsExamples.ts](../../../../apps/playground/src/gallery/fixtures/FormsExamples.ts). This covers render/SSR compatibility, not all interaction behavior.
- Focused test references: [Forms.contract.dom.test.ts](../../../../tests/unit/presentation/forms/Forms.contract.dom.test.ts). Consult the named test assertions for the behavior actually covered.
- Required follow-through for changes: verify the affected state, keyboard, focus, composition and cleanup paths; the existence of this specification is not a passing-test claim.
