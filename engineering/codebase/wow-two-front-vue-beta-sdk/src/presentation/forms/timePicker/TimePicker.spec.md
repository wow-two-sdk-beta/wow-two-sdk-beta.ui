# TimePicker

Renders a trigger button that opens popover hour and minute columns and shows the picked time.

Source: [TimePicker.vue](TimePicker.vue).

Public import: `import { TimePicker } from '@wow-two-beta/ui-vue/presentation/forms';`.

## Contract

- Each controlled axis has one Vue model name and one update event. Primary values use `modelValue` / `update:modelValue`; disclosure uses `open` / `update:open`. Named axes use their declared `update:*` event. Defaults seed uncontrolled state once; external updates do not emit intent.
- Native form reset requests the original seed through the outer state owner. Nested controls reconcile without issuing their own default requests. Composite drafts remount from the resolved state. A cancelled reset changes nothing.

- The committed state uses the shared controlled-state helper: supplied controlled state is read from props; user changes report intent. The default seeds uncontrolled state. External prop updates do not themselves emit user changes.
- Automatic attribute inheritance is disabled; the source explicitly forwards and merges supported fallthrough attributes.

## Props

| Prop | Type | Required | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `modelValue` | `Temporal.PlainTime \| null` | no | — | The selected time, controlled. The `v-model` binding target. |
| `defaultValue` | `Temporal.PlainTime \| null` | no | — | The uncontrolled initial selection. |
| `minuteStep` | `number` | no | `5` | The minute interval. Default 5. |
| `placeholder` | `string` | no | `'Pick a time'` | The empty-state text on the trigger. |
| `format` | `(time: Temporal.PlainTime) => string` | no | `(t: Temporal.PlainTime) => t.toString({ smallestUnit: 'minute' })` | The trigger's time formatter. Kept a PROP, not an emit: it RETURNS the rendered string, which an emit cannot do. |
| `isInvalid` | `boolean` | no | `undefined` | The invalid surface override. Falls back to the surrounding form control's `isInvalid`. |
| `name` | `string` | no | — | The hidden input name; when set, a hidden input ships the value with form submission. |
| `size` | `SelectPickerSize` | no | — | The trigger size. |
| `state` | `InputState` | no | — | The validity surface. |
| `id` | `string` | no | — | The trigger's id. Auto-filled from `FormControl` context when omitted. |
| `disabled` | `boolean` | no | `undefined` | The disabled state. Falls back to the surrounding form control's `isDisabled`. |

## Emits

| Event | Signature | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `update:modelValue` | `'update:modelValue': [time: Temporal.PlainTime \| null];` | Fires when the reader picks an hour or a minute in the popover. The `v-model` half. |

## Slots

None declared.

## Exposed handle

`{ el: computed(() => trigger.value?.el ?? null) }`. Read this through a component template ref after mount; the referenced DOM node may be absent while unmounted.

## Verification

- Public render fixture: [FormsExamples.ts](../../../../apps/playground/src/gallery/fixtures/FormsExamples.ts). This covers render/SSR compatibility, not all interaction behavior.
- Focused test references: [DateTimeControls.dom.test.ts](../../../../tests/unit/presentation/forms/DateTimeControls.dom.test.ts). Consult the named test assertions for the behavior actually covered.
- Required follow-through for changes: verify the affected state, keyboard, focus, composition and cleanup paths; the existence of this specification is not a passing-test claim.
