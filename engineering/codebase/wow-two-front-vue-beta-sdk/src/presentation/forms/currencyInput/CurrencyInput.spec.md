# CurrencyInput

Renders a `NumberInput` behind a leading currency symbol; the typed value stays the bare number.

Source: [CurrencyInput.vue](CurrencyInput.vue).

Public import: `import { CurrencyInput } from '@wow-two-beta/ui-vue/presentation/forms';`.

## Contract

- Each controlled axis has one Vue model name and one update event. Primary values use `modelValue` / `update:modelValue`; disclosure uses `open` / `update:open`. Named axes use their declared `update:*` event. Defaults seed uncontrolled state once; external updates do not emit intent.
- Compose using the props, slots and events below. Preserve the rendered element’s native semantics and provide the required content/data.
- Automatic attribute inheritance is disabled; the source explicitly forwards and merges supported fallthrough attributes.

## Props

Inherited contracts: `extends NumberInputProps`. These members remain part of the component surface.

| Prop | Type | Required | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `symbol` | `string` | no | `'$'` | The currency symbol or 3-letter code displayed as a prefix. Default `"$"`. |

## Emits

None declared.

## Slots

None declared.

## Exposed handle

`{ el: computed(() => inner.value?.el ?? null) }`. Read this through a component template ref after mount; the referenced DOM node may be absent while unmounted.

## Verification

- Public render fixture: [FormsExamples.ts](../../../../apps/playground/src/gallery/fixtures/FormsExamples.ts). This covers render/SSR compatibility, not all interaction behavior.
- Focused test references: [Forms.contract.dom.test.ts](../../../../tests/unit/presentation/forms/Forms.contract.dom.test.ts). Consult the named test assertions for the behavior actually covered.
- Required follow-through for changes: verify the affected state, keyboard, focus, composition and cleanup paths; the existence of this specification is not a passing-test claim.
