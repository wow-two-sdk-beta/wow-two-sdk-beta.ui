# FileUploadPicker

Renders a drag-drop zone that also opens the native picker on click, Enter or Space.

Source: [FileUploadPicker.vue](FileUploadPicker.vue).

Public import: `import { FileUploadPicker } from '@wow-two-beta/ui-vue/presentation/forms';`.

## Contract

- Compose using the props, slots and events below. Preserve the rendered element’s native semantics and provide the required content/data.
- Automatic attribute inheritance is disabled; the source explicitly forwards and merges supported fallthrough attributes.

## Props

| Prop | Type | Required | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `accept` | `string` | no | — | The `accept` token list handed to the native input and used for validation. |
| `multiple` | `boolean` | no | `false` | Whether more than one file may be picked. Default `false`. |
| `maxSize` | `number` | no | — | The per-file byte cap. Files exceeding this drop into `rejected`. |
| `maxFiles` | `number` | no | — | The cap on total accepted files (multiple mode). Excess go to `rejected`. |
| `isInvalid` | `boolean` | no | `undefined` | The invalid surface override. Falls back to the surrounding form control's `isInvalid`. |
| `label` | `string \| number` | no | `'Drop files here, or click to browse'` | The zone's headline. Fill the `label` slot for richer content. |
| `hint` | `string \| number` | no | — | The zone's sub-line. Fill the `hint` slot for richer content. |
| `disabled` | `boolean` | no | `undefined` | The disabled state. Falls back to the surrounding form control's `isDisabled`. |
| `name` | `string` | no | — | The native input name. |
| `id` | `string` | no | — | The control's id. Auto-filled from `FormControl` context when omitted. |

## Emits

| Event | Signature | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `files-change` | `'files-change': [accepted: ReadonlyArray<File>, rejected: ReadonlyArray<FileRejection>];` | Fires when the reader drops or picks files, carrying them split into accepted and rejected. |

## Slots

| Slot | Signature | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `default` | `default?(): unknown;` | The content rendered under the drop zone — the default slot. |
| `label` | `label?(): unknown;` | See the declared signature. |
| `hint` | `hint?(): unknown;` | See the declared signature. |

## Exposed handle

`{ el: input }`. Read this through a component template ref after mount; the referenced DOM node may be absent while unmounted.

## Verification

- Public render fixture: [FormsExamples.ts](../../../../apps/playground/src/gallery/fixtures/FormsExamples.ts). This covers render/SSR compatibility, not all interaction behavior.
- Required follow-through for changes: verify the affected state, keyboard, focus, composition and cleanup paths; the existence of this specification is not a passing-test claim.
