# Field

Renders label, control, helper and error as one block, wiring the control through form-control context.

Source: [Field.vue](Field.vue).

Public import: `import { Field } from '@wow-two-beta/ui-vue/presentation/forms';`.

## Contract

- Compose using the props, slots and events below. Preserve the rendered element’s native semantics and provide the required content/data.
- Automatic attribute inheritance is disabled; the source explicitly forwards and merges supported fallthrough attributes.

## Props

| Prop | Type | Required | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `label` | `string \| number` | no | — | The label text. Fill the `label` slot instead for richer content (e.g. label + tooltip). |
| `helper` | `string \| number` | no | — | The helper / hint shown beneath the control. Hidden while errors show. |
| `error` | `string \| number` | no | — | The error text — renders only when truthy. Sets `isInvalid` on the form context. Inside a forms-engine `Field` this is an OVERRIDE: leave it unset and the field's own errors (client + server, all of them) render automatically. |
| `isRequired` | `boolean` | no | `undefined` | The required state (also exposes `isRequired` to the control via context). |
| `isDisabled` | `boolean` | no | `undefined` | The disabled state (also exposes `isDisabled` to the control). |
| `isReadOnly` | `boolean` | no | `undefined` | The read-only state (also exposes `isReadOnly` to the control). |

## Emits

None declared.

## Slots

| Slot | Signature | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `default` | `default(): unknown;` | See the declared signature. |
| `label` | `label?(): unknown;` | See the declared signature. |
| `helper` | `helper?(): unknown;` | See the declared signature. |
| `error` | `error?(): unknown;` | See the declared signature. |

## Exposed handle

`{ el: root }`. Read this through a component template ref after mount; the referenced DOM node may be absent while unmounted.

## Verification

- Public render fixture: [FormsExamples.ts](../../../../apps/playground/src/gallery/fixtures/FormsExamples.ts). This covers render/SSR compatibility, not all interaction behavior.
- Focused test references: [DateTimeControls.dom.test.ts](../../../../tests/unit/presentation/forms/DateTimeControls.dom.test.ts), [Forms.contract.dom.test.ts](../../../../tests/unit/presentation/forms/Forms.contract.dom.test.ts). Consult the named test assertions for the behavior actually covered.
- Required follow-through for changes: verify the affected state, keyboard, focus, composition and cleanup paths; the existence of this specification is not a passing-test claim.
