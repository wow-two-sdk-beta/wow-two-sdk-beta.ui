# MonthView

Renders the month grid of an `EventCalendarViewer`.

Source: [MonthView.vue](MonthView.vue).

Internal implementation: compose through the family’s public exports in [index.ts](index.ts).

## Contract

- Compose using the props, slots and events below. Preserve the rendered element’s native semantics and provide the required content/data.
- Undeclared attributes follow Vue fallthrough to the rendered root when the component has a single element root.

## Props

| Prop | Type | Required | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `focusDay` | `Temporal.PlainDate` | yes | — | Declared by the source contract. |
| `timeZone` | `string` | yes | — | Declared by the source contract. |
| `events` | `ReadonlyArray<EventCalendarViewerEvent>` | yes | — | Declared by the source contract. |
| `weekStart` | `0 \| 1` | yes | — | Declared by the source contract. |

## Emits

| Event | Signature | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `event-click` | `'event-click': [event: EventCalendarViewerEvent];` | Fires when an event block is clicked. |
| `slot-click` | `'slot-click': [day: Temporal.PlainDate, hour?: number];` | Fires when an empty day cell's date button is clicked. |

## Slots

None declared.

## Exposed handle

No explicit exposed handle.

## Verification

- This internal part is exercised through its owning family; no independent public render fixture is claimed.
- Required follow-through for changes: verify the affected state, keyboard, focus, composition and cleanup paths; the existence of this specification is not a passing-test claim.
