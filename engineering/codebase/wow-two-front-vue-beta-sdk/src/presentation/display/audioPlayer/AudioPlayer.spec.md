# AudioPlayer

Renders an audio player with play/pause, a scrubber, volume, and speed over a native `<audio>`.

Source: [AudioPlayer.vue](AudioPlayer.vue).

Public import: `import { AudioPlayer } from '@wow-two-beta/ui-vue/presentation/display';`.

## Contract

- Compose using the props, slots and events below. Preserve the rendered element’s native semantics and provide the required content/data.
- Automatic attribute inheritance is disabled; the source explicitly forwards and merges supported fallthrough attributes.

## Props

| Prop | Type | Required | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `src` | `string` | yes | — | The audio source URL. |
| `peaks` | `ReadonlyArray<number>` | no | `undefined` | The pre-computed per-bin amplitudes — swaps the range scrubber for an `AudioWaveformPreview`. |
| `autoPlay` | `boolean` | no | `undefined` | The autoplay state, forwarded to the native `<audio>`. |
| `loop` | `boolean` | no | `undefined` | The loop state, forwarded to the native `<audio>`. |
| `defaultVolume` | `number` | no | `1` | The initial volume in 0..1. Default `1`. |
| `defaultPlaybackRate` | `number` | no | `1` | The initial playback rate. Default `1`. |
| `isCompact` | `boolean` | no | `undefined` | The dense layout. Default `false`. |

## Emits

| Event | Signature | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `play` | `play: [];` | Fires when playback starts. |
| `pause` | `pause: [];` | Fires when playback pauses. |
| `time-update` | `'time-update': [time: number, duration: number];` | Fires when playback time advances, with the current time and the total duration. |
| `ended` | `ended: [];` | Fires when playback reaches the end. |

## Slots

None declared.

## Exposed handle

`{ el }`. Read this through a component template ref after mount; the referenced DOM node may be absent while unmounted.

## Verification

- Public render fixture: [DisplayExamples.ts](../../../../apps/playground/src/gallery/fixtures/DisplayExamples.ts). This covers render/SSR compatibility, not all interaction behavior.
- Required follow-through for changes: verify the affected state, keyboard, focus, composition and cleanup paths; the existence of this specification is not a passing-test claim.
