// The Vue seam — an ambient registry so a screen deep in the tree can contribute commands without threading a
// registry through props, following the repo's `LocaleContext` / `DirectionContext` provide + inject shape.
//
// Non-obvious decisions:
// - `useCommands` THROWS without a provider, where `useLocale` falls back to a default. A locale has a sane
//   default (`en-US`); a registry does not — a silent fallback would accept registrations into a throwaway store
//   and the palette would just be empty, which is far harder to debug than a named error.
// - `useRegisterCommands` keys its watcher on a CONTENT signature of the commands, never on array identity. The
//   React original needed that to avoid an infinite register → notify → re-render → register loop; here it earns
//   its place for a plainer reason: a `computed` array rebuilt on an unrelated dependency would otherwise churn
//   the registry (and the palette's row order) for no change the user could see.
// - Because the watcher skips identity changes, the entries it registers delegate `run` / `when` back through
//   `toValue` to the LATEST value of the caller's source. Without that, a handler closing over reactive state
//   would be frozen at the value that last changed the signature. Text metadata is part of the signature, so it
//   re-registers when it changes; behaviour is always live. Net effect: the caller memoizes nothing.
// - The signature is built with `JSON.stringify`, not a delimiter join: JSON quoting makes each field
//   self-delimiting, so a title containing the delimiter can't forge a boundary and alias two different sets.
// - Nothing here touches a platform global, so the registration watcher is `immediate` — a server-rendered
//   palette lists the commands its subtree registered, exactly as the client does.
