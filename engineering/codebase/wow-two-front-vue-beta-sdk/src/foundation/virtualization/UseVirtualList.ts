// The Vue binding for the windowing math: watch a scroll container, and hand back only the items that need to
// exist in the DOM. Headless — it renders nothing and dictates no markup; it returns numbers.
//
// WHAT THE COMPOSABLE ACTUALLY OWNS: three pieces of state (scroll offset, viewport size, a measurement
// version) and the watchers that keep them true. Everything geometric is delegated to
// `Windowing`/`Measurements`, which stay pure and node-testable. If a change is about "which items", it
// belongs there, not here.
//
// THE CONTAINER IS RESOLVED REACTIVELY, which deletes the original's re-resolve-on-every-commit effect. A
// template ref is itself reactive, so a swapped, unmounted, or conditionally rendered container simply
// re-triggers the computed. `getScrollElement` is still supported for a container held outside a ref, but it
// is only re-read when something else in the same computed changes — prefer `target` when the node can move.
//
// SCROLL ANCHORING — the hard part, and the reason this composable is more than 40 lines:
//
//   When an item ABOVE the fold turns out to be taller than its estimate, every pixel below it shifts down by
//   the difference. The user is looking at those pixels, so the list visibly jumps under them — the classic
//   "content leaps while you're reading" bug in every hand-rolled virtual list. The fix is to add the same
//   delta to the scroll position, which cancels the shift exactly: same content, same pixels.
//
//   Two details make it actually work:
//
//   1. WHEN to compensate. Only when the re-measured item ends AT OR ABOVE the viewport's top edge. If it
//      merely straddles that edge, its own top is pinned above the fold and does not move, so the content the
//      user is reading is already stable — compensating there would CAUSE the jump instead of preventing it.
//      Below the fold, nothing visible moves at all.
//
//   2. WHEN to apply it. Not inside `measureItem`: at that moment the container is still its old height, so
//      assigning a larger `scrollTop` gets silently clamped by the browser and the correction is lost. It is
//      staged as an accumulated delta and applied from a `flush: 'post'` WATCHER — after Vue patches the taller
//      spacer, before the browser paints. The applied value is then read back from the DOM, because the browser
//      is the authority on how far the container can actually scroll.
//
//   Deltas accumulate rather than overwrite: several items commonly re-measure in one flush, and each must
//   contribute.
//
// LOOP SAFETY: `measureItem` is a no-op when the size is unchanged. That single guard is what keeps a consumer
// wiring it to a ResizeObserver from spinning measure -> render -> measure forever.
//
// SSR: every DOM read sits behind a resolved-element guard inside a post-flush watcher, and `target` resolves
// to `null` on the server, so nothing here touches `scrollTop`, `clientHeight`, or `ResizeObserver` during a
// server render. The reported window is the one implied by `initialViewportSize`.
