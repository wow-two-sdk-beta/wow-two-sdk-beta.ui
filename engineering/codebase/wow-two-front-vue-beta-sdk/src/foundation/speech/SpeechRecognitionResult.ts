/**
 * Why a recognition session ended badly. Eight arms, four of them sharing `foundation/media`'s vocabulary.
 *
 * - `denied` — the microphone is blocked, by the user or by the browser / OS. Not retryable without a settings
 *   change, so re-prompting on a timer only annoys.
 * - `unavailable` — no usable input device. A desktop with no microphone, or an unplugged one.
 * - `no-speech` — the engine listened and heard nothing. Ordinary, and the most common ending of all: expect it
 *   whenever a user presses the button and hesitates.
 * - `network` — the recognition service was unreachable. Chrome performs recognition SERVER-SIDE, so this is
 *   routine offline, and no amount of retrying fixes it without a connection.
 * - `aborted` — the app stopped the session (`abort()`, an unmount). A decision, not a failure.
 * - `language-unsupported` — the service will not transcribe the requested `lang`.
 * - `unsupported` — no recognition API here: SSR, or Firefox, which does not implement it.
 * - `failed` — anything else, including an unreadable event.
