// The wire model every sink sees. Two decisions worth stating:
//
// - **`context` is always present, never optional.** An empty object costs one allocation and removes a
//   branch from every sink and every assertion — the opposite trade from `AnalyticsEvent.properties`,
//   which omits itself because a vendor payload is size-sensitive on the wire. A log record is consumed
//   locally first.
// - **`error` is already serialized when it arrives.** An `Error` stringifies to `{}` (`name` / `message` /
//   `stack` are non-enumerable), so a sink that ships records off the device would silently send empty
//   objects. Shaping it once in the logger — via `serializeError` from `foundation/errors` — means every
//   sink gets a JSON-safe, cycle-free, depth-capped payload without re-solving it.
//
// The whole record is `readonly`: one object is shared across the fan-out, so a sink that mutated it would
// corrupt what the sinks after it see.
