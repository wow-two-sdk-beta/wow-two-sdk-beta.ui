// The logger every app talks to. One contract dominates every decision in this file:
//
// DEFINING CONTRACT: NO METHOD HERE THROWS. `logger.error(...)` is called from `catch` blocks, error
// boundaries, and unhandled-rejection handlers — precisely where a second exception masks the first and
// takes down the path that was meant to recover. So the emit body is wrapped end to end, every sink is
// invoked in isolation, and `onError` (itself wrapped) is the only place a failure ever surfaces. A hostile
// context, a `Proxy` that throws from every trap, a sink that always throws, a clock that throws: all
// degrade to a dropped or partial record, never to a raised exception.
//
// Decisions worth stating:
//
// - **The threshold is checked FIRST, before any work.** Merging context, walking it for redaction and
//   serializing an error all cost more than a suppressed line is worth. Only the caller's own arguments are
//   evaluated (`logger.debug('x', expensive())` still pays for `expensive()` — that is JS, not us); nothing
//   this module controls is spent below the threshold, and no sink is touched.
// - **`child()` forks the CONTEXT, and only the context.** Sinks, redaction config, `onError` and the clock
//   are shared with the root — and so is the LEVEL, held in one mutable cell for the whole tree. That makes
//   `setLevel` a single runtime dial ("turn debug on") instead of something to re-apply across every child
//   an app has spawned. A child cannot diverge from its parent's level; that is the design, not a gap.
// - **Context merges parent-first, so the more specific writer wins:** root < child < grandchild < call
//   site. A child re-binding `requestId` overrides its parent's, which is how a reader expects the nearest
//   scope to describe the record.
// - **`error()`'s second argument is the ERROR unless it is a plain object that is not error-like.** This
//   mirrors how TypeScript picks the overload — an `Error` instance is not assignable to `LogContext`
//   (no index signature), so `error(msg, err)` resolves to the error signature and `error(msg, { userId })`
//   to the context one. The one addition is that a PLAIN object which is error-like (`{ message: '…' }`) is
//   also taken as the error, because `catch (e) { log.error('failed', e) }` — where a library threw a
//   non-`Error` — is the whole reason the overload exists, and `e` is typed `unknown` there. The cost: a
//   context whose fields include `message` reads as an error. Disambiguate with `error(msg, undefined, ctx)`.
// - **One record object is shared across the fan-out.** Building a copy per sink would be pure waste;
//   `LogRecord` is fully `readonly` so a sink is expected to treat it as immutable.
