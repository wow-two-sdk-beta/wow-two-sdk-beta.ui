// The multi-format write — one clipboard entry carrying the same content in several MIME types at once.
//
// WHY MULTI-FORMAT IS THE POINT. The clipboard holds ONE item with MANY representations, and the paste target
// picks the richest one it understands. Write `text/html` alone and a plain `<textarea>` receives nothing; write
// `text/plain` alone and a rich editor receives markup-free text. Writing both in a SINGLE `write` call means
// pasting into Word or Notion keeps the formatting while pasting into a terminal still works. Two sequential
// `writeText` + `write` calls do NOT achieve this — the second overwrites the first.
//
// `copyBlob` is the single-format case of the same call, spelled for the payload consumers actually reach for
// (a generated PNG, a canvas export).
//
// Legacy degradation is text-only, and only from a string arm. `document.execCommand('copy')` can put text on
// the clipboard and nothing else, so a rich write degrades to its `text/plain` representation or not at all. A
// `Blob`-valued text arm is skipped rather than awaited: reading it is async, while the legacy path is
// synchronous and must stay inside the user gesture that authorized the copy.
