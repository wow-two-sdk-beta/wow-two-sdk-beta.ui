// The 90% API: one object store, typed, addressed like a `Map`. Almost every real use of IndexedDB is a
// keyed cache — offline documents, draft attachments, decoded media, a query cache that must survive a
// reload — and none of it needs indexes, ranges, or multi-store transactions. Those stay reachable
// (`openDatabase` + `withTransaction` + `iterate` are exported unchanged for the other 10%); this is the
// surface that keeps a caller from hand-rolling the boilerplate for the common case.
//
// ERROR CONTRACT — ONE MODEL, NO MIXING: **every method rejects with a normalized `Error` on failure, and
// nothing here ever throws synchronously.** Deliberately unlike `foundation/storage`, whose broker swallows
// failures and degrades a bad read to a miss. That is right for `localStorage`: the payload is small, cheap
// to re-derive, and a lost preference is a shrug. It is wrong here — the payloads are large, often the only
// copy (an unsent draft, a queued upload), and a write that silently vanishes is data loss the caller was
// never told about. Quota exhaustion, in particular, is a real and recoverable condition that a caller can
// only handle if it is told. Absence is NOT failure: `get` resolves `undefined` for a missing key, `has`
// answers the ambiguous case (IndexedDB can store `undefined` as a value), and both are normal results.
//
// CONNECTION LIFECYCLE. The database is opened lazily on the first operation, never at construction — so
// `createKeyValueStore` is safe to call at module scope under SSR, where nothing may touch `indexedDB`. The
// open promise is cached and shared by concurrent callers, and dropped again whenever the connection dies:
// a failed open (so the next call retries rather than replaying a stale rejection), a `versionchange` from
// another tab (`openDatabase` closes the handle to avoid deadlocking it — see that file's header), or a
// browser-forced `close`. The next operation transparently re-opens. That is what makes a store held in a
// module-scope `const` survive a second tab upgrading the schema underneath it.
