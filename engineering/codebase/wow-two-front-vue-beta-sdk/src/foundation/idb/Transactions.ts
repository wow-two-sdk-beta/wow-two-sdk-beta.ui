// Store-level operations: run a unit of work inside one transaction, and walk a store with a cursor.
//
// WHY `withTransaction` RESOLVES ON COMMIT, NOT ON THE LAST REQUEST. A `put` reports success as soon as the
// value is accepted, well before the transaction commits — and a transaction can still abort afterwards
// (quota exceeded, a constraint violation from a sibling request, an explicit `abort()`). Resolving on the
// last request's success would therefore report writes as durable that a moment later never happened. The
// completion listener is attached synchronously at creation, BEFORE the work runs, because `complete` can
// fire the instant the work function returns; attaching it after would race the event.
//
// FAILURE => ROLLBACK, ALWAYS. If the work function throws or rejects, the transaction is aborted rather
// than left to commit whatever it managed to do first. The error that surfaces is the work function's, not
// the resulting `AbortError`: the cause the caller can act on is "your callback threw", not "something
// rolled back". The completion rejection is deliberately absorbed in that path so it does not resurface as
// an unhandled rejection.
//
// THE AUTO-CLOSE HAZARD APPLIES INSIDE `fn` — awaiting anything that is not an IDB request promise commits
// the transaction out from under the rest of the callback. Full explanation and worked example:
// `IdbPromises.ts` header, TRAP 1.
//
// WHY `iterate` EXISTS ALONGSIDE `getAll`. `getAll()` materializes every record into one array: fine for a
// few hundred small rows, ruinous for a store holding thousands of Blobs, where the peak is the whole store
// resident in memory at once. A cursor streams one record at a time at constant memory, and can stop early.
// It cannot reuse `requestToPromise` — a cursor request re-fires `success` on every `continue()`, and a
// settle-once wrapper would silently truncate the walk to a single record — so it runs its own loop.
