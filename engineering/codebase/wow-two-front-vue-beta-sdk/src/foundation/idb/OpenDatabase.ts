// Opening and deleting a database — the two operations that can DEADLOCK, and the reason this file carries
// more machinery than a thin promise wrapper would suggest.
//
// THE BLOCKED DEADLOCK. A version upgrade (and a delete) needs exclusive access. If any other connection to
// the same database is still open — most often the same app in a second tab, running the previous deploy —
// the request cannot proceed. IndexedDB does not fail it: it fires `blocked` and then WAITS, indefinitely,
// for the other connection to close. A caller that only listens for `success` / `error` gets a promise that
// never settles, which surfaces as a spinner that spins forever with nothing in the console. It is the
// classic IndexedDB production bug, and it is invisible in single-tab development.
//
// Both sides of that deadlock are handled here:
//  - INBOUND, we time-box it. `blocked` starts a timer; if the open has not gone through by
//    `blockedTimeoutMs`, the promise rejects with an error that names the cause. A defined failure beats an
//    infinite wait — the app can prompt "close other tabs and reload" instead of hanging.
//  - OUTBOUND, we refuse to be the blocker. Every connection opened here gets a `versionchange` handler that
//    CLOSES it, so when another tab upgrades or deletes, this tab yields immediately instead of blocking it.
//    That is the reciprocal half most wrappers omit, and omitting it is what makes the deadlock common.
//
// The cost of yielding: after `versionchange` the handle is dead, and further use rejects with
// `InvalidStateError`. `createKeyValueStore` absorbs this by dropping its cached connection and re-opening
// on the next call; a caller holding a raw `IDBDatabase` should pass `onVersionChange` and re-open (or
// reload) itself.
//
// UPGRADE SEMANTICS. `upgrade` runs inside the browser's own version-change transaction. It is the ONLY
// place `createObjectStore` / `createIndex` / `deleteObjectStore` may be called, it must be synchronous
// (awaiting non-IDB work there commits the transaction out from under the schema — see `IdbPromises.ts`),
// and it may be called with any `oldVersion` from 0 (fresh database) upward, so migrations must be written
// as a ladder of `if (oldVersion < n)` steps rather than an if/else on the previous version.
