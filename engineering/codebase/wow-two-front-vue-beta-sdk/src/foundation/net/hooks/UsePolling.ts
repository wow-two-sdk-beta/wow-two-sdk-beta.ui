// Vue binding for `createPoller` — one loop per scope, stopped when the scope is disposed.
//
// THE LIFETIME RULE THIS ENFORCES: a poller holds a timer plus a `visibilitychange` and two connectivity
// listeners. A disposed scope that never stopped its poller keeps all four, keeps issuing requests, and keeps
// writing into state that no longer renders — except it also costs a request every interval, forever.
//
// BUILT FROM `onMounted`, NEVER FROM AN IMMEDIATE WATCHER. `createPoller` attaches its `visibilitychange`
// listener to `document` and its connectivity listeners to `window`; an immediate watcher also runs during a
// server render, where neither exists. `onMounted` is client-only by construction.
//
// `fn` IS READ THROUGH `toValue` AT CALL TIME rather than captured. A component's `setup` runs once, so the
// React original's infinite-restart hazard (a fresh `fn` identity every render, each render caused by the
// previous poll's own state write) simply cannot occur here — but reading it per tick is still the right
// contract, because it lets a caller pass a getter whose target changes without rebuilding the loop.
//
// The suspend rules (hidden tab, offline) belong to the poller itself, not to this composable, so a
// framework-free caller gets identical behaviour — see `CreatePoller.ts`. In particular this composable does
// NOT call `useOnlineStatus`: doing so would update reactive state on every connectivity flip merely to tell
// the poller something it already knows from the same events.

 *
 * The loop stops when the scope is disposed and is rebuilt whenever `intervalMs` changes. `fn` is read fresh
 * on each tick, so a getter whose target changes needs no rebuild.
 *
 * @param fn - The work to repeat; a returned promise is awaited before the next tick is scheduled.
 * @param options - Interval and suspension behaviour, read once when the loop is built; handler callbacks are
 *   re-read per emission, so a ref or getter keeps them live.
 * @returns The poller state and `pause` / `resume` / `stop`.
