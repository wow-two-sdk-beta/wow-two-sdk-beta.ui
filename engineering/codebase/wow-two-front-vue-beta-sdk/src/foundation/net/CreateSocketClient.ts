// A WebSocket client that fixes the three bugs every hand-rolled one has: dropped early sends, an
// intentional close that reconnects anyway, and a half-open socket nobody notices.
//
// (1) MESSAGES SENT WHILE `CONNECTING` ARE LOST. A `WebSocket` is not usable the moment it is constructed —
// the handshake takes a round trip, and `send()` during `CONNECTING` throws `InvalidStateError`. The bug is
// not the throw; it is that the throw happens in code that looks obviously correct (`const s =
// createSocket(); s.send(hello)`) and disappears on a fast local connection, so it ships. This client QUEUES
// anything sent before `OPEN` and flushes it, in order, on open — the same queue that covers sends during a
// reconnect, when the socket is `CONNECTING` again for seconds at a time.
//
// The queue is BOUNDED (`queueLimit`, default 100) and drops the OLDEST frame when full. Unbounded is not an
// option: a tab left open through an hour-long outage would otherwise accumulate every frame the app ever
// tried to send and hand the server all of them at once on reconnect. Oldest-first is the right end to drop
// for the state-update traffic sockets usually carry, where the newest frame supersedes the ones behind it —
// a caller whose messages are commands rather than state should keep `queueLimit` small and watch
// `queuedCount`.
//
// (2) AN INTENTIONAL `close()` MUST NOT RECONNECT. `onclose` fires for a network drop and for a deliberate
// close identically, so a reconnect handler wired to it fights every logout, unmount, and navigation — the
// socket keeps coming back, usually with the OLD credentials. A single `closedByCaller` flag, set before the
// close is requested, is the whole fix; every reconnect path checks it.
//
// (3) A HALF-OPEN SOCKET REPORTS `OPEN` FOREVER. When a peer vanishes without a close frame — a laptop lid, a
// dropped NAT entry, a killed load balancer — TCP has nothing to report, so `onclose` never fires and
// `readyState` stays `OPEN`. The connection is dead and the app cannot tell. The only detector is an
// application-level heartbeat: send a ping, require traffic back within a deadline, treat silence as death
// and reconnect. Note the ping MUST be application-level — the WebSocket protocol has real ping/pong frames,
// but browsers expose no API to send one, so a server-side-only heartbeat cannot be observed from here.
//
// ANY INBOUND FRAME CLEARS THE PONG DEADLINE, not just a frame matching some pong shape. A socket delivering
// data is alive by definition, so requiring a specific reply would kill healthy busy connections whose pong
// is merely queued behind other traffic. This also means a server needs no pong support at all for the
// heartbeat to be useful on a chatty socket.
//
// All reconnect delays come from `Reconnect.ts`, hence from `foundation/resilience`. None are computed here.
