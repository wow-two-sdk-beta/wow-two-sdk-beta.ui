// Vue binding for `createEventStream` — one stream per scope, closed when the scope is disposed.
//
// THE LIFETIME RULE THIS ENFORCES: an `EventSource` is a live HTTP connection that outlives the component
// that opened it. Nothing about unmounting a tree closes it, so a route change away from a page holding an
// un-closed stream leaves the connection open, the handlers subscribed, and the reconnect timer armed — and
// navigating back opens a SECOND one. Binding the stream to `onMounted` / `onScopeDispose` makes the teardown
// automatic.
//
// OPENED FROM `onMounted`, NEVER FROM AN IMMEDIATE WATCHER. `createEventStream` resolves `EventSource` inside
// the call, and an immediate watcher also runs during a server render. `onMounted` is client-only by
// construction, so the SSR pass reports `closed` / `supported: true` and the stream opens at hydration.
//
// HANDLERS ARE READ THROUGH `toValue` AT CALL TIME, the Vue counterpart of the original's handlers-in-a-ref.
// A component's `setup` runs once, so a plain options object is already stable — but a caller that wants
// genuinely live handlers can pass a ref or getter and every callback re-reads it per event, with the stream
// itself staying put.
//
// OPTIONS ARE READ ONCE, when the stream opens. Changing `retry`, `events`, or `withCredentials` after mount
// does NOT rebuild the stream; only `url` does. Options are configuration, not state — a consumer that must
// genuinely swap them at runtime should remount with a `key`. This mirrors `useSyncChannel` in
// `foundation/sync`.
//
// A `null` URL MEANS "NOT YET", not "broken" — the shape every real app needs while it waits for a token or a
// route param. No stream is opened, and the state reads `closed`.
