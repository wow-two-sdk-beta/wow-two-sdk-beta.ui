// The connection vocabulary shared by every long-lived transport in this slice, plus the two sets of WIRE
// ready-state numbers the platform uses.
//
// WHY A SEPARATE STATE FROM THE WIRE NUMBER: `EventSource.readyState` and `WebSocket.readyState` are both
// small integers, they overlap numerically, and they mean DIFFERENT things — `2` is `CLOSED` for an
// `EventSource` and `CLOSING` for a `WebSocket`. Worse, neither can express "the socket is down and this
// wrapper is waiting out a backoff delay before the next attempt", which is the state a UI most wants to
// render ("reconnecting…"). `EventSource` reports that situation as `CONNECTING`, indistinguishable from the
// very first connect. So consumers get this string union and never see a raw integer.
//
// WHY THE NUMBERS ARE SPELLED OUT HERE RATHER THAN READ OFF THE GLOBALS: `WebSocket.OPEN` is a static member
// of a class that does not exist under SSR, in a node test, or in a browser with the API disabled. Reading it
// at module scope is a `ReferenceError` at import time — the exact failure this slice promises never to have.
// The values are fixed by the WHATWG spec and cannot drift, so hardcoding them is both safe and the only
// SSR-correct option.
