// `useInView` — "is this element on screen?" as a boolean, over `observeIntersection`. The primitive under
// lazy-loading, reveal-on-scroll, infinite-scroll sentinels, and autoplay-when-visible.
//
// THE WHOLE REF-DIFFING MACHINE THE REACT ORIGINAL NEEDED IS GONE, and its absence is the point. There, a
// `RefObject` mutation does not re-render, so the hook had to run an effect after EVERY render and diff
// `ref.current` against what was actually observed — otherwise it kept observing a node detached three renders
// ago and reported a stale `false` for an element that IS on screen. In Vue a template ref is itself reactive,
// so `watchPostEffect` re-runs precisely when the element changes and never otherwise. Options are read through
// `toValue` in the same effect, so a changed threshold re-subscribes for free — no fingerprint comparison, no
// no-deps effect, no separate unmount-only cleanup.
//
// POST-FLUSH, so the element is in the DOM before the observer attaches — the same reason
// `foundation/hooks`' `useResizeObserver` is post-flush. Under SSR the target resolves to `null` and the effect
// returns before touching `IntersectionObserver`.
//
// UNSUPPORTED FAILS OPEN, AND FAILS OPEN FROM THE EFFECT. `inView: false` is right while the answer is unknown
// but wrong forever: reveal-on-scroll content stays invisible and lazy images never load, i.e. the page is
// broken for the user with the oldest browser. So when `IntersectionObserver` is missing the state reports
// `true` (`fallbackInView`, opt-out). It does that from the EFFECT, never from the seed value, because the
// effect does not run on the server — computing the fallback at setup would make the server emit `true` and the
// client hydrate `false`, which is a hydration mismatch.
//
// `once` DISCONNECTS PERMANENTLY, including across a later element change. A reveal that un-reveals is a bug,
// and a lazy-loaded image does not need un-loading; keeping the observer alive after the first hit is pure cost
// on the scroll path where cost is most visible.
