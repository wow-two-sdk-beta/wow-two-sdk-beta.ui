// `useIntersectionObserver` — the MULTI-element form: many targets, ONE observer, one callback.
//
// AN OBSERVER PER LIST ITEM IS THE CLASSIC PERFORMANCE MISTAKE THIS COMPOSABLE EXISTS TO PREVENT. Reaching for
// `useInView` inside a row component feels natural and scales badly: a 500-row table builds 500 observers, and
// the browser then walks 500 separate observation sets on every scroll-driven intersection pass instead of one.
// The API is explicitly built for the many-target case — `observe()` takes an element, and a single observer
// delivers ALL of their entries in one batched callback. That batching is the win, and it only exists if the
// targets share an observer.
//
// THE OBSERVER SURVIVES TARGET CHURN. Rows mount and unmount constantly; rebuilding the observer for each would
// throw away the batching AND re-fire an initial callback for every surviving target. So the effect diffs the
// live target set against what is currently observed and issues only `observe()` / `unobserve()` for the delta.
// A new observer is constructed exactly once per options change — nothing else. That is why the observer and
// its observed set live OUTSIDE the effect and the teardown hangs off `onScopeDispose` rather than the
// watcher's `onCleanup`: a per-run cleanup would be the churn this design exists to avoid.
//
// NO `once` HERE, ON PURPOSE. It is per-TARGET state, and this composable shares one observer across all of
// them: honouring it would mean either disconnecting everybody on the first target's hit, or tracking a
// per-element settled set — which is `useInView` per item, i.e. the thing this composable exists to avoid. A
// consumer wanting once-per-row semantics keeps that bookkeeping in its own state, where the row identity
// already lives.
//
// POST-FLUSH, and the targets are read through `toValue`, so the effect re-runs exactly when the reactive target
// list changes. Under SSR the list resolves empty and nothing is constructed.
