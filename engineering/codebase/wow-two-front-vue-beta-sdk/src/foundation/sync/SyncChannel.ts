// The cross-tab wire contract — the vocabulary every transport in this slice speaks, kept in its own module so
// the factory, the hooks, the leader election, and the in-memory test hub all agree on one shape.
//
// WHY AN ENVELOPE AND NOT A BARE MESSAGE: `BroadcastChannel` already refuses to deliver a tab its own message,
// but the `storage`-event fallback has no such rule — a write is visible to every listener that shares the
// origin, and in the fallback's own tab the listener would happily fire on its own write. Normalizing that
// difference needs a sender identity ON THE WIRE, so both transports wrap the payload the same way and the
// dispatch path filters `sender === self` once, for everyone. The envelope also carries `seq`, which does two
// jobs the timestamp cannot: it makes every write to the fallback's single storage key a distinct string (some
// browsers skip the `storage` event when `setItem` writes a byte-identical value), and it gives the receiver a
// stable identity for a duplicate dispatch.
//
// `TMessage` IS A COMPILE-TIME CONTRACT ONLY. A peer is another copy of the page, not a trusted caller — the
// envelope shape is validated at runtime, the payload inside it is not. A tab running an older bundle can put
// anything in `message`; a consumer that treats a channel as a security or integrity boundary is holding it
// wrong. Same-origin only, and only as trustworthy as the origin's own code.
