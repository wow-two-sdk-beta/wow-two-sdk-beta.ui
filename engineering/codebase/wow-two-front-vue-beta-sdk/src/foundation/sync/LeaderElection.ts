// Exactly one tab does the work. The recurring cross-tab problem this solves: five open tabs each opening a
// WebSocket, each running the same poll, each firing the same notification. Electing a leader lets four of them
// stand down, and — the part that is easy to get wrong — lets one of them take over when the leader dies.
//
// WHY NOT `navigator.locks`: `LockManager.request` is the browser's own answer and is genuinely better where it
// exists — the lock is released by the browser itself when the tab dies, with no timeout and no heartbeat. It is
// also absent from every Safari before 15.4 and from every non-secure context, and it cannot express "tell me
// when I've LOST leadership" without holding a promise open. This implementation needs neither, rides on the
// same channel as the rest of the slice, and works wherever a message can be delivered.
//
// THE ALGORITHM, and why it is shaped this way:
//   - CLAIM WINDOW. A starting tab does not wait out the full timeout to discover whether a leader exists; it
//     posts a `claim` and listens for `claimWindow` ms. A live leader answers with a heartbeat and the claimant
//     stands down. Silence means the throne is empty. Startup therefore costs ~150ms, not ~3.5s.
//   - TIE-BREAK: LOWEST ID WINS. Two tabs claiming in the same window each see the other's claim, and both
//     apply the same total order, so exactly one concludes it won — no extra round-trip, no coin flip. Ids are
//     UUIDv7 (`createSyncChannel`), which is TIME-ORDERED: lowest id = earliest-created tab. So the rule is not
//     arbitrary, it is "the tab that has been open longest leads", which is also the tab most likely to hold
//     warm state.
//   - HEARTBEAT + EXPIRY IS THE WHOLE POINT. A tab that is killed — process crash, force-quit, OOM, laptop lid,
//     `pagehide` never firing — cannot announce anything. So leadership is a LEASE, not a grant: the leader
//     re-asserts every `heartbeatInterval`, and any follower that sees nothing for `timeout` presumes it dead
//     and claims. Without this the whole slice would deadlock on its first crash, which is the failure mode
//     leader election exists to prevent.
//   - SPLIT BRAIN HEALS. Two leaders can coexist briefly (a channel partition, a suspended-then-resumed tab
//     whose lease expired elsewhere). On hearing a rival heartbeat the higher id steps down; the lower re-asserts.
//
// INVARIANT ON THE TIMINGS: `timeout` must exceed `heartbeatInterval` by a comfortable multiple — the default
// 3500 / 1000 tolerates two dropped or delayed heartbeats. Set them too close and a merely busy main thread
// (a long task, a background-throttled timer) reads as a crash and leadership flaps. Not clamped, because a
// test legitimately wants tight values; stated because a consumer legitimately gets it wrong.
//
// SAFETY, NOT LIVENESS-AT-ANY-COST: during a partition each side may elect its own leader. This is a UI
// coordination tool — use it to suppress duplicate work, never as a distributed lock over something that must
// not happen twice.
