// Bounded concurrency — run N tasks at once out of an unbounded submission stream. The gap this fills:
// `Promise.all` starts EVERYTHING at once, which is fine for 5 items and a self-inflicted outage for 500
// (browsers stall past ~6 connections per host, servers rate-limit, memory holds every in-flight payload).
//
// `foundation/uploads`' `UploadQueue` already implements this privately (its `controllers` map is the pool
// and `pump` is the scheduler) — it predates this slice and is NOT edited from here. Whether it should
// later delegate is noted in the barrel; nothing in this file assumes it will.
//
// ORDER IS GUARANTEED FOR START, NOT FOR COMPLETION, and the distinction is the whole contract. Tasks begin
// in submission order — a FIFO queue drained one entry per freed slot — but a slow first task finishes after
// a fast second one. Any caller that needs results in input order must key them by index rather than by
// arrival, which is exactly what `mapLimit` does via `Promise.all`.
//
// Non-obvious decisions:
// - `active` is incremented SYNCHRONOUSLY inside `start`, before `fn` is called, so the counter can never
//   lag behind reality. Incrementing after an `await` would open a window where two tasks both observe a
//   free slot and the cap is briefly exceeded — the bug a test that only checks final results never sees.
// - `fn` is invoked inside an async IIFE, so a task that throws SYNCHRONOUSLY rejects its own promise
//   instead of taking down the scheduler. Without it, one bad task leaks a permanently-held slot and the
//   pool deadlocks at N-1, then N-2, until nothing runs.
// - The slot is freed in `finally` and `drain` is called there, so the pump advances on failure exactly as
//   it does on success.
// - The queue is drained with `shift()`. O(n) per drain in principle; irrelevant against the cost of the
//   async work being scheduled, and it keeps the pool a dozen readable lines.
