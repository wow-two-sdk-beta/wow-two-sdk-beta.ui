// The deadline primitive `foundation/resilience` does not have. That slice models RETRIES over HTTP statuses
// (`shouldRetry(policy, count, status)` · `computeRetryDelay`) and deliberately owns no timeout, so every
// caller needing "fail if this takes longer than N ms" had to hand-roll one — `foundation/workers`'
// `WorkerClient` did exactly that for its per-call deadline. This is the shared implementation; retry and
// timeout stay orthogonal, and a caller wanting both composes them (`retryAsync` around `withTimeout`).
//
// THE TIMER MUST DIE ON EVERY EXIT PATH, which is the entire reason this is a shared primitive rather than
// four lines inlined per call site. A pending `setTimeout` is a live handle: in node it keeps the event loop
// alive (a CLI that finished its work hangs until the longest deadline elapses), and in a browser it pins
// every closure it captures — the promise, its result, whatever the callback closes over — for the full
// duration. A fast-resolving call under a 30s deadline therefore leaks for 30s unless the timer is cleared,
// and the leak scales with request volume. So `cleanup` runs on resolve, on reject, on abort, and on the
// deadline itself; the test asserts `vi.getTimerCount() === 0` on both settle paths.
//
// Non-obvious decisions:
// - A non-positive or non-finite `ms` means NO DEADLINE, matching `WorkerClient`'s reading, rather than
//   "expire immediately". `withTimeout(p, config.timeoutMs ?? 0)` then degrades to a plain pass-through
//   instead of failing every call, which is the safer wrong-config behaviour.
// - `onTimeout` exists because rejecting the caller does NOT stop the underlying work (see `Abort.ts`).
//   It is the hook where you abort the real operation — `onTimeout: () => controller.abort()`.
// - A THROW FROM `onTimeout` IS SWALLOWED. It fires while the timeout rejection is being built; letting it
//   escape would replace a precise `TimeoutError` with an unrelated failure from a cleanup hook, and the
//   caller would never learn the deadline was the actual cause.
