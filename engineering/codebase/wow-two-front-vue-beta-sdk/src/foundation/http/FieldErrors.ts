/*
 * Reads the per-field validation failures out of a thrown error's problem body.
 *
 * TWO READERS, ONE PARSE. `fieldIssues` is the wide one — it keeps each failure's rule code and
 * operands, which is what a message catalogue keys on (`foundation/validation/Messages.ts`).
 * `fieldErrors` is the narrow one, kept for the `Record<string, string[]>` shape the forms engine has
 * always exposed; it delegates and drops everything but the message.
 *
 * WHY THE CODE WAS WORTH RESCUING: the wow-two backend already puts it on the wire —
 * `{"errors":[{"property":"Rules[0].Content.Url","message":"URL is required.","code":"NotEmptyValidator"}]}`
 * — and every client discarded it right here, which is why the client and the server could never agree
 * on the wording of a rule they both enforce.
 *
 * NORMALIZATION HAPPENS ON THIS SIDE ON PURPOSE. FluentValidation's `ErrorCode` vocabulary
 * (`NotEmptyValidator`) is not the vocabulary the client's own validators report (`required`), and one
 * catalogue cannot serve two. Translating here — rather than waiting for the server to emit the shared
 * codes — lets a form adopt the catalogue today and keeps working unchanged once the backend normalizes
 * too, since an already-shared code passes through the alias table untouched.
