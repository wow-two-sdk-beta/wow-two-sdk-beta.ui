// The in-process channel double — `memoryStorageBroker`'s parallel for this slice, and for the same reason: a
// consumer testing cross-tab behaviour needs two endpoints that can talk without a browser, a second tab, or a
// real transport.
//
// WHY IT EXISTS RATHER THAN "just use the real thing in tests": Node has `BroadcastChannel`, but it delivers
// through the event loop. Under `vi.useFakeTimers` the loop is no longer the test's to drive, so a leader
// election — whose entire logic is timers reacting to messages — becomes a race between faked timers and real
// async delivery. This hub delivers SYNCHRONOUSLY, inside `post`, which collapses that race: post, and every
// peer has already reacted before the next line runs. That makes heartbeat, expiry, and hand-over assertions
// deterministic instead of flaky.
//
// It keeps every rule the real transports keep — sender exclusion, safe fan-out, closed endpoints going quiet —
// because a double that is more forgiving than production is a double that hides bugs.
//
// WHAT IT DELIBERATELY DOES NOT MODEL: structured-clone or JSON round-tripping. Payloads are passed by
// reference, so a test can pass a `Map` the `storage` fallback would have destroyed, and a mutation after
// `post` is visible to the receiver. Serialization limits belong to the transports; assert those against the
// transport that has them.
