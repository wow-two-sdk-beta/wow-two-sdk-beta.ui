// State that is LIVE-SHARED between open tabs and dies with the last one.
//
// PICKING BETWEEN THIS AND `usePersistentState` (`foundation/storage`) — they overlap by one line in a table and
// differ everywhere else:
//
//   | | `usePersistentState` | `useBroadcastState` |
//   |---|---|---|
//   | Where the value lives | `localStorage` (durable) | memory, in each tab (ephemeral) |
//   | Survives a reload / restart | yes | no — last tab closes, value is gone |
//   | Cross-tab sync | yes, as a side effect of the `storage` event | yes, deliberately, over the channel |
//   | Sync when `BroadcastChannel` exists | still the `storage` event | `BroadcastChannel` |
//   | Cost per update | a storage write | a message |
//   | Reaches a tab opened later | yes, it reads storage | yes, via the mount-time request/announce below |
//
// USE `usePersistentState` for anything the user would expect to still be there tomorrow — theme, collapsed
// sidebar, draft text, consent. USE THIS for state that is only meaningful while the tabs are open: which tab is
// playing audio, a live cursor position, "a sync is running", a wizard step mirrored across windows. Writing
// ephemeral state through `localStorage` leaves litter that outlives its meaning and re-appears, stale, on the
// next visit; persisting it is the actual bug that this composable exists to avoid.
//
// THE LATE-JOINER PROBLEM, AND THE FIX: a message-only mirror leaves a tab opened later holding `initial` while
// everyone else has moved on — it hears only FUTURE changes. So on mount this composable posts a `request`, and
// every tab already holding the value answers with an `announce`. With several peers, several answers arrive;
// they agree, so last-write-wins is harmless. A tab that opens when NO other tab is open keeps `initial`, which
// is correct — there is no shared value to inherit.
//
// NOT A CONFLICT-FREE TYPE. Two tabs writing in the same instant both broadcast, and each ends on whichever
// message it received last — the values can diverge. Fine for state with one natural writer at a time; wrong
// for a shared editable document, which needs a CRDT or a server, not a broadcast.
//
// THE CHANNEL OPENS IN `onMounted`, never at setup: `createSyncChannel` reaches for `BroadcastChannel` and
// `window`. Under SSR the value is simply `initial` and the setter is local, exactly as the original.
