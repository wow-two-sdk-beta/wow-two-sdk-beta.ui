// The Vue binding for FLIP: snapshot geometry across an update, animate the difference.
//
// WHY `flush: 'post'` AND NOT A DEFAULT WATCHER — this is the whole reason the composable exists:
//
//   A pre-flush watcher runs BEFORE Vue patches the DOM, so a rect measured there is the OLD box and the FLIP
//   has nothing to invert. A `flush: 'post'` watcher runs after the patch but still inside the same tick, so
//   the invert lands in the same frame as the layout change and the first thing the user sees is the
//   animation's first frame. This is the exact counterpart of the original's `useLayoutEffect`: post-commit,
//   pre-paint. There is no correct pre-flush version of this composable.
//
// HOW THE SNAPSHOT SURVIVES THE UPDATE: there is no "before the change" callback. Instead the composable
// measures at the END of every run and keeps that rect in a closure variable. On the next `deps` change the
// variable still holds the PREVIOUS commit's geometry — that is "First" — and a fresh measurement is "Last".
// So the snapshot is always one commit old by construction, which is exactly what FLIP wants.
//
// `onMounted` SEEDS THE FIRST SNAPSHOT and animates nothing: a mount is an enter transition, which is
// `foundation/primitives`' `Presence`, not this slice. It is also why nothing here runs in an immediate
// watcher — `measureRect` reads the element's box, and there is no element on the server.
//
// Reduced motion is read here (`useReducedMotion`) rather than inside `playFlip`, keeping the pure layer
// Vue-free. An explicit `reducedMotion` option still wins, so a consumer can force either behaviour.

 * browser paints.
 *
 * Takes the element as a ref or getter rather than handing one back, so a `useTemplateRef` drops straight in.
 * SSR-safe: nothing is measured until `onMounted`.
 *
 * @param target The element whose layout changes.
 * @param deps The watch source(s) whose change signals "the layout just moved".
 * @param options Duration, easing, the reduced-motion override, and `enabled`. Read at play time.
