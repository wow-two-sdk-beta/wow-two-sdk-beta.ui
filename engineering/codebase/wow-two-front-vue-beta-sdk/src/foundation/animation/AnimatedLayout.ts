// The multi-child FLIP: a container that animates its children to their new positions whenever their order or
// count changes. List reordering, filtering, sorting, drag-drop settle.
//
// AUTHORED AS `defineComponent` IN PLAIN TS, not as an SFC, because its whole job is vnode manipulation — it
// clones each slot child to stamp an identity attribute on it, which a template cannot express. Same shape as
// `foundation/primitives`' `Slot` / `Presence`.
//
// DELIBERATELY SMALL. It is `useFlip`'s loop, not a layout engine — no enter/exit choreography, no shared-element
// transitions, no spring physics. Children that mount or unmount simply appear/disappear at their final spot
// (`Presence` is the primitive for enter/exit); only the SURVIVING children are animated, which is precisely the
// case CSS cannot do at all.
//
// NON-OBVIOUS DECISIONS:
//
//  - IDENTITY COMES FROM `key`, NOT DOM ORDER. Order is the thing that changes, so a positional index cannot
//    identify a child across updates. Each child vnode is cloned with a `data-flip-key` carrying its Vue key,
//    and rects are stored in a `Map` under it. The cost: a child must let unknown attributes fall through to
//    its DOM node — intrinsic elements (`<li>`, `<div>`) do this for free, a component must keep the default
//    `inheritAttrs: true` and render a single root. An unkeyed child gets a positional key and so is not
//    tracked across a reorder; that is inherent (Vue cannot track it either), not a gap to fix here.
//
//  - THE TRIGGER IS `onUpdated`, NOT A WATCHER. The trigger is "the children rendered differently", which is
//    not expressible as a watch source — comparing children by value each update costs more than the two
//    `getBoundingClientRect` reads the hook does, and `playFlip` short-circuits when nothing moved. `onMounted`
//    and `onUpdated` both run after the patch and before paint, which is what FLIP requires.
//
//  - MEASURE ALL, THEN PLAY ALL. Two passes, not one interleaved loop: starting an animation on child 1 dirties
//    style state, so measuring child 2 afterwards would force a fresh layout recalc per child (layout thrash on
//    a long list).
