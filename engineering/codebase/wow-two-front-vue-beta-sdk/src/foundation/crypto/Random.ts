// Cryptographically secure randomness over `crypto.getRandomValues`. Available in insecure contexts too, so
// this works where the digest helpers do not — see `WebCrypto.ts` for the split.
//
// The one non-obvious thing in this file is **modulo-bias rejection sampling**, and it is the reason
// `randomString` exists at all rather than being a two-line snippet at each call site. The naive form
//
//     alphabet[randomByte % alphabet.length]
//
// is skewed. A byte is uniform over 0..255 — 256 values. With a 62-char alphabet, 256 = 4x62 + 8, so the
// residues 0..7 are each reachable from 5 bytes while residues 8..61 are reachable from only 4. The first
// 8 characters of the alphabet come up ~25% more often than the rest. That is invisible in a smoke test and
// measurable by an attacker over enough samples, which is precisely the wrong failure shape for a token.
//
// The fix: discard every byte at or above the largest multiple of the alphabet size that fits in 256
// (`rejectionLimit`), and only then take the modulo. For 62 that limit is 248, so bytes 248..255 are thrown
// away and the remaining 248 map 4-to-1 onto 62 characters — exactly uniform. The cost is a re-draw for
// ~3% of bytes, which is why the generator over-draws and loops instead of asking for exactly `length`.
//
// `randomStringFrom` takes its byte source as a parameter so the rejection path is testable with a
// deterministic stream. It is exported from the file but deliberately absent from the barrel — the
// "internal" signal in this repo is absence from `index.ts`, not a naming prefix.
//
// Note the scope boundary: this slice does NOT generate identifiers. `foundation/identifiers` owns UUID
// generation (`Guid.createV4` / `Guid.createV7`) and should be used for entity ids — `randomString` is for
// opaque tokens, nonces, and suffixes where a UUID's structure would be meaningless.
