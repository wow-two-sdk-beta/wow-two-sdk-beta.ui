// Web Crypto resolution + capability probes — the single place this slice reads the ambient
// `globalThis.crypto`. Isolated for two reasons.
//
// 1. The two capabilities fail INDEPENDENTLY, so they must be probed separately. `crypto.getRandomValues`
//    is available in every modern runtime, secure context or not; `crypto.subtle` is available ONLY in a
//    secure context (https, localhost, or a file/extension origin) and is `undefined` on a plain `http://`
//    page served from a LAN IP — a setup that looks fine in dev and breaks on a staging box. Collapsing
//    both into one "crypto available" flag would report random-byte generation as broken whenever digests
//    are, and vice versa.
// 2. The global is read at CALL time, never cached at module scope. Caching would freeze an `undefined`
//    captured during SSR/hydration into the module for the page's lifetime, and would block a test from
//    stubbing `globalThis.crypto` to exercise a failure path.
//
// SSR contract for the whole slice, stated once here and echoed on each consumer: the pure helpers
// (`Encoding`, `timingSafeEqual`) never touch this file and run anywhere — SSR, workers, insecure origins.
// The digest and random helpers THROW at the call site when their capability is missing, rather than
// returning a sentinel: a silently unhashed value or a non-random "random" byte is a security defect that
// a fallback would hide, so failing loudly is the only safe default. Callers that must branch instead of
// catch use `isCryptoAvailable()` / `isSubtleAvailable()`.
