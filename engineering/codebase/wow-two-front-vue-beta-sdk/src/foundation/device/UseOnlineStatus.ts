// Network reachability — or as much of it as the browser is willing to admit to.
//
// WHAT `navigator.onLine` ACTUALLY MEANS: it is `false` only when the browser is certain there is NO network link
// — airplane mode, Wi-Fi off, cable unplugged. It is `true` the moment a link exists and says NOTHING beyond that.
// A captive portal nobody has logged into, hotel Wi-Fi that has not been paid for, a dropped VPN, a DNS failure,
// or an API that is simply down all report `true`. So `false` is trustworthy and `true` is a hint.
//
// USE ACCORDINGLY: explain a failure that already happened ("you appear to be offline"), defer a retry, pause a
// poll. Never treat `true` as a precondition — "we are online, so this request will succeed" is exactly the
// inference this value cannot support. Proving the server that matters is reachable takes a request to it, which
// is `foundation/http`'s job and not this slice's.
//
// The `online` / `offline` events bind through `foundation/hooks`' `useEventListener` rather than a hand-rolled
// `addEventListener`, so handler identity, attach options, and teardown follow the same rules as every other
// listener in the library. The target is a GETTER, not a module constant: resolving `window` at module scope
// would evaluate during a server render, and the lazy getter is the same shape `useEventListener` uses for its
// own default.
