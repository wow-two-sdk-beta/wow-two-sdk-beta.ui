// The main-thread half of the RPC: turns a `Worker`'s fire-and-forget `postMessage` pipe into typed,
// awaitable method calls.
//
// THE CENTRAL DESIGN CONSTRAINT — WHY THERE IS A MAP INSTEAD OF A LISTENER PER CALL.
// The tempting implementation is: post the request, attach a one-shot `message` listener, resolve from it,
// remove it. That reads cleanly and is WRONG, because `postMessage` gives no ordering guarantee between a
// request and its reply. A worker whose handlers are async — a `fetch`, an IndexedDB read, anything
// awaited — finishes them in completion order, not arrival order. So issue `slow()` then `fast()` and the
// replies come back `fast`, `slow`. A one-shot listener resolves the FIRST reply it sees, so `slow()`
// receives `fast()`'s value with the right type and a plausible-looking value, and `fast()` receives
// `slow()`'s. Nothing throws. There is no stack trace. The two results are simply swapped, and the bug
// only appears once two calls overlap — which in development, with one call at a time, they never do.
//
// The fix is the only fix: correlate explicitly. Every request carries a monotonic id, ONE permanent
// listener owns the pipe, and it routes each reply to the pending entry that id names. The out-of-order
// case is covered by a test that makes the worker answer the second request first.
//
// LEAK DISCIPLINE. The pending map is the one place this class can leak, since an entry holds a promise's
// resolve/reject closures alive forever. Every exit path removes its entry through the same `settle` call:
// a reply, a timeout, a worker-level error, and `terminate`. A late reply arriving after its entry is gone
// is dropped silently — it is the expected consequence of a timeout, not an error to report.
//
// TIMEOUTS ARE NOT DRIVEN FROM `foundation/resilience`, and that is deliberate rather than an oversight:
// that slice models RETRIES over HTTP statuses (`computeRetryDelay`, `shouldRetry(policy, count, status)`)
// and has no timeout primitive to reuse. A per-call deadline over a stateful pipe is a different shape —
// there is no status to classify and a retry would re-run a handler that may not be idempotent. Retrying a
// worker call is the consumer's decision, and a consumer that wants one can wrap `call` with that slice's
// helpers.
//
// ERROR ATTRIBUTION SPLITS IN TWO, because the two failures carry different amounts of information:
//  - a handler that throws is caught INSIDE the worker and replied to with its own id, so exactly one call
//    rejects and its siblings are untouched;
//  - an `ErrorEvent` on the worker itself (a script that failed to parse, a top-level throw) carries NO
//    id — nothing identifies which call, if any, provoked it, and the worker is generally unusable
//    afterwards. Rejecting only a guess would strand the rest, so every in-flight call rejects.
// An `ErrorEvent` is also not an `Error` — it is an event with `message` / `filename` / `lineno` and an
// `error` member that is `null` for a cross-origin script. That is precisely what `toError` is for.

 * over `keyof TApi` asks the same question (is every member callable?) without ever requiring one.
