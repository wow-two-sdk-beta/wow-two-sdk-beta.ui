// Selection — the canonical model behind every selectable surface (DataTable rows, Listbox options, tree
// nodes, transfer lists). Pure and immutable: every op takes a state and returns a state, never mutates,
// and returns the SAME reference when the op changed nothing — so a memoized consumer can skip work on an
// inert click without a deep compare.
//
// Why a `Set` plus a separate anchor rather than one array of keys: membership is the hot path (one test
// per rendered row), and the anchor is selection *history*, not selection *content* — a shift-click must
// know where the last plain click landed, and that has to survive ops that don't touch the key set.
//
// Why `mode` lives IN the state instead of being a per-call argument: the invariants then hold
// structurally. `none` makes every mutating op inert and `single` caps the set at one key no matter which
// op a caller reaches for, so a single-select list cannot accumulate keys by calling the wrong function.
//
// The set-shaped ops (`selectAll`, `invert`, `toggleAll`, `selectionStatus`) all take an explicit key list
// rather than reading some ambient "all rows". That list is the caller's CURRENT FILTERED PAGE, which is
// the whole point: a header checkbox on a filtered table must mean "all matching rows", and selections
// made outside the current filter must survive it.
