// The Vue seam over the pure selection model — state ownership only. Every op here is `commit(pureOp(...))`;
// no selection logic lives in this file, so a headless caller and a component behave identically.
//
// Controlled value = the KEY ARRAY, not the whole `SelectionState`. A consumer that controls selection wants
// to own "what is selected" (it round-trips to a URL, a form, a server); it does not want to own the anchor,
// which is interaction history with no meaning outside this composable. So the keys flow through
// `useControlled` while the anchor stays internal — which is what makes shift-click keep working on a fully
// controlled list, where a naive implementation loses the anchor whenever the parent republishes its keys.
//
// The mode is applied by re-deriving the state through `createSelection` in a `computed`, so a controlled
// parent that hands `['a','b']` to a `single`-mode list gets the model's normalisation rather than an invalid
// state.
//
// `commit` short-circuits on reference equality: the pure ops return the same state for a no-op, so an inert
// click (a `none`-mode row, deselecting an unselected key) fires no `onSelectionChange` at all.
