// The Vue subscription seam over a queue — how a component updates as uploads progress. Mirrors `commands`'
// `UseCommandRegistry.ts`: the store is framework-free, this file is the only part that imports Vue.
//
// Non-obvious decisions:
// - These track `queue.version()` as the subscription snapshot, NOT `items()` / `state()`. Both build a fresh
//   value per call, so either as the snapshot would look changed on every read. The monotonic counter is
//   identity-stable between mutations; the arrays and the aggregate derive from it through a `computed`.
// - The subscription is attached in `onMounted` and dropped in `onScopeDispose`, the same shape
//   `foundation/device`' `useMediaQuery` uses. The queue is plain in-memory state with no client-only source, so
//   the SSR pass reads a correct version rather than a placeholder — the mount hook exists for the listener, not
//   for a platform global.
// - `useUploadQueueSnapshot(queue)` takes the queue EXPLICITLY, so an app that owns a module-scope queue (uploads
//   that must survive tearing down the panel) can subscribe without this file creating anything.
// - `useUploadQueue(options)` is the convenience on top and creates its queue ONCE, at setup — the queue holds
//   in-flight work, so rebuilding it on a changed option would strand running uploads. Consequence, stated
//   plainly: `concurrency` / `accept` / `maxSize` / `retry` are read at SETUP and later changes are ignored.
//   Need them dynamic → own the queue and re-create it deliberately.
// - `transport` is the exception: it is delegated through `toValue`, so an inline `{ upload: ... }` closing over
//   current props stays live instead of being frozen at setup. Same trick `provideCommands` uses for `onError`,
//   and it is what makes the common inline call site correct without any memoization by the caller.
// - The action callbacks are the queue's own methods, already referentially stable, so nothing wraps them.
