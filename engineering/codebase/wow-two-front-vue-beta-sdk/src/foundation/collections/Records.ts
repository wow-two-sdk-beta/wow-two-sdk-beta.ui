// Records — the keyed-collection half of the slice: turning a list into a lookup, and reshaping the
// lookup without mutating it.
//
// MAP FOR DERIVED LOOKUPS, RECORD FOR DECLARED SHAPES. `keyBy` returns a `Map` because the key comes from
// the data at runtime and may be any type — a plain object would stringify a numeric id and reorder
// integer-like keys ahead of string ones. `pickKeys` / `omitKeys` / `invertRecord` take records because
// their keys are part of the caller's declared type, and the return type is derived from it (`Pick` /
// `Omit`), which is the whole reason to prefer them over hand-written destructuring.
//
// `mapValues` straddles the two on purpose: it is overloaded so `groupBy(...)` → `mapValues(groups, (rows)
// => rows.length)` keeps its `Map`, while a config record stays a record. One name, because the intent is
// identical and a caller should not have to remember which container they are holding.
//
// STRING KEYS ONLY on the record helpers. They walk `Object.keys`, so own enumerable STRING keys are
// visited: symbol keys are skipped, and a numeric key comes back as its string form (JavaScript's rule,
// not this slice's). Prototype-inherited properties are never copied.
