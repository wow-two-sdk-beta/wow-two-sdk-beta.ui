 * ```vue
 * <script setup lang="ts">
 * const { data } = await useAppSuspenseQuery({ key: ['user'], queryFn });
 * </script>
 * ```
 *
 * `@tanstack/vue-query` ships no `useSuspenseQuery` — Vue suspends on an async `setup()` rather than
 * on a thrown promise, so the library exposes `suspense()` on the query result and this awaits it.
 * That makes this composable ASYNC where React's was synchronous, the one shape change the two
 * suspense models force.
 *
 * The caller still owns both boundaries: a `<Suspense>` for loading, and an error boundary for
 * failure — a rejected query rejects this promise and bubbles past the hook.
