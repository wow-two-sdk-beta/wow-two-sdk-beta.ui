 * Wires `localStorage` persistence for the query cache (opt-in — call from `main.ts`); returns null
 * when there is no `window` (SSR-safe).
 *
 * Built on `dehydrate` / `hydrate` straight out of `@tanstack/vue-query` rather than on the
 * `persist-client` + `sync-storage-persister` package pair: those two are separate installs, and the
 * whole of what they add over this is an async persister interface this synchronous store does not
 * need. The restore is therefore SYNCHRONOUS — the cache is already hydrated when the call returns,
 * and `restored` is an already-settled promise kept for API parity.
 *
 * Caveats to weigh before opting in:
 * - **Sensitive data** — every allowlisted successful query dehydrates into `localStorage` in plain text,
 *   including authenticated user data; any script on the origin can read it. Do not enable on apps
 *   whose cache holds secrets/PII, or scope what queries cache to begin with.
 * - **Version busting** — pass `buster` (e.g. the app version) whenever a release changes cached
 *   shapes; a restored stale shape otherwise flows into typed hooks unchecked.
 * - **Quota** — a full `localStorage` makes the write silently fail (no retry strategy is wired);
 *   the app keeps working, persistence just lags.
 * - **Rich values** — this JSON persistence does not preserve Temporal objects or class instances.
 *   Allowlist only JSON payload caches; keep decoded rich values in computed presentation mappings.
