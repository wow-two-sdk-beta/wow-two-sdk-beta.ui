# Vue convention-sweep migration

*Last updated: 2026-09-25*

This records the published `0.0.6` migration and the unreleased full-sweep changes below.
React is parked and has a different public API; importing the Vue package is not a symbol-for-symbol package swap.

## Unreleased full SDK sweep

This candidate is not published. Consumer changes are intentional: the Vue SDK is owned internally,
and no production consumer requires compatibility shims. React is outside this pass.

| Capability | Consumer change |
|---|---|
| Google Identity | Call `provideGoogleIdentity(options)` once in an ancestor; descendants call argument-free `useGoogleIdentity()` or render `GoogleSignInButton`. The button no longer owns credentials/client configuration. |
| Auth + requests | Share an explicitly owned `RequestScope` through the auth bridge, API client and query adapters. Session invalidation cancels old work and rejects stale side effects. |
| HTTP metadata | Use `client.detailed.get/post/...` for `{ value, status, headers }`; existing body-only methods retain their shape. |
| Exact editing | `ExactNumberInput` models `ExactNumber | null`; draft text commits on Enter/blur, Escape restores, invalid drafts preserve the last committed model. |
| Exact formatting | `formatExactNumber` supports currency/percent with exact arithmetic. Rounding is explicit; currency names are unsupported. |
| Config JSON | Replace unchecked `json<T>()` with `json(decoder)` returning a typed Result; bare `json()` returns unknown and parses losslessly. |
| Defaults | Mutable validator/config defaults use `defaultFactory`, never one shared mutable value. |
| Object flags | `getObject/evaluateObject(key, fallback, decoder, context?)` require a Result decoder. Use `useObjectFlag` for object values; `useFlag` accepts scalars. |
| Hashing/downloads | `stableStringify`, `hashObject` and `downloadJson` use strict lossless JSON. Encode custom instances explicitly; represent fractions/unsafe integers as ExactNumber. |
| Tables | Column `compare(left,right)` supports domain ordering without coercion; the built-in path preserves ExactNumber/bigint ordering. |
| Native forms | Composite controls carry name/disabled/external form ownership into hidden native fields; read-only controls suppress mutations. |
| Field arrays | Shared canonical row keys preserve field/touched/error identity across multiple views and nested moves; stale validation cannot overwrite new edits. |

`LosslessJson.stringify(value, { space, sortKeys })` adds optional pretty/canonical serialization.
Hashing preserves numeric spelling, including scale and exponent; normalize ExactNumber first if a
cache should treat alternate equal spellings identically. Native fractional values fail rather than
silently inheriting a rounded number.

### Locale and direction

Component-authored defaults read the nearest `LocaleProvider`; explicit text props/slots win.
Keys follow `ComponentName.messageName`, and omitted values retain English fallback text. Changing
locale/messages updates mounted controls. Complete messages use named variables, allowing word reordering:

```vue
<LocaleProvider locale="fr-FR" :messages="{
  'DataTable.emptyContent': 'Aucun résultat.',
  'PdfViewer.pageNumber': 'Page {page}',
}">
  <App />
</LocaleProvider>
```

Direction remains explicit through `DirectionProvider`; locale does not infer document direction.
Use identical locale/direction inputs on server and initial client render. Source specs and the
[message catalogue](../../architecture/analysis/vue-sdk-optimization/component-messages.md) list defaults.

### Behavioral changes

Inactive slotted actions stop native activation in capture phase. Focus restoration belongs to the
shared scope, with an explicit context-menu return target. Code editor Escape releases the following
Tab including modifier-key sequences. Calendars project into the displayed zone, use exclusive ends,
show overlapping events separately and preserve multi-day continuation. DiffViewer uses linear working
memory while retaining quadratic worst-case time; large rendered diffs still need paging.

Browser capabilities now isolate observer exceptions and stale completions from resource cleanup.
Retries validate delay math but continue supporting explicit infinite reconnect budgets. Upload attempts
own their progress callbacks. Virtualized sizes follow stable item keys. Theme CSS applies dark tokens
when `.dark` is the theme host or an ancestor.

## Entry points

| Retired entry | Replacement |
|---|---|
| `foundation/format` | `foundation/formatters` |
| `foundation/sync` | `foundation/channels` |
| `foundation/undo` | `foundation/history` |
| `foundation/validation` | `foundation/validators` |
| `foundation/utils` | Capability-specific entries below |
| `foundation/hooks` | Capability-specific composables below |

Utility ownership:
- `foundation/styles`: class merging, variants, styles and visual tokens.
- `foundation/dom`: element/ARIA/event vocabulary, DOM and keyboard operations, polymorphic helpers.
- `foundation/animation`: transition operations.
- `foundation/collections`: equality comparers.
- `foundation/i18n`: locale-aware comparison.
- `foundation/config`: environment flags.
- `foundation/optionals`: optional-value construction.

The root `utils` and `hooks` namespaces are removed. Root `styles`, `dom`, `optionals` and `state` namespaces are available;
use dedicated subpaths for the other capabilities. Vue Query requires `^5.102.8`;
`query/testing` additionally requires optional `@vue/test-utils@^2.4.6`.

## Composable ownership

The generic hooks entry is retired. Import each composable from its owning capability:

| Capability | Former generic composables |
|---|---|
| `foundation/state` | controlled state, disclosure |
| `foundation/dom` | event listeners, outside clicks, focus trapping, scroll locking |
| `foundation/shortcuts` | Escape key |
| `foundation/identifiers` | identifiers |
| `foundation/device` | media queries, reduced motion |
| `foundation/observers` | resize observers |
| `foundation/async` | debounced handlers |
| `foundation/storage` | autosave, persistence, recent items |
| `foundation/selection` | typeahead |
| `foundation/clipboard` | clipboard controls |

Source role grouping does not rename other public capability entries. Forms source uses
`formsEngine/adapters/{house,tanstack}`; its public entries remain `forms-engine/house` and
`forms-engine/tanstack`. The storage adapter remains `foundation/storage/zustand` publicly.

## Exact numeric JSON prototype

New `foundation/numbers` and `foundation/json` entries expose `ExactNumber` and `LosslessJson`.
Configure `createApiClient({ json: LosslessJson })` to preserve numeric tokens in requests, responses and
diagnostics. This is explicit opt-in; all numeric response fields become ExactNumber and need matching
endpoint decoders. Encoding native fractional/unsafe numbers fails; construct exact values from their
original decimal text or bigint. Native arithmetic/JSON operators do not implement this value type.

Both form adapters preserve immutable ExactNumber values in snapshots and use numeric equality for dirty
tracking. Existing number-valued controls and schemas are not automatically converted to exact-number
controls. Use `ExactNumberInput` for canonical decimal editing, or an explicit parser for custom editors.

`ApiFailure.problem` and `ApiError.problem` are raw readonly records: validate their members before use.
The HTTP transport's `failure.status` stays a native number; a numeric diagnostic body member retains the
selected codec's representation. The separately exported `ProblemDetails` model remains available for
validated contracts.

## Component models and events

The canonical model sweep updates 95 component surfaces. Use these model names on the renamed
components in the family table below; old aliases and duplicate change notifications are removed.

| Previous binding | Current binding |
|---|---|
| Primary `value` / `update:value` or `value-change` | `modelValue` / `update:modelValue` |
| Checkbox, radio and switch `checked` / `defaultChecked` | `modelValue` / `defaultValue` |
| Toggle `isPressed` / `defaultPressed` | `modelValue` / `defaultValue` |
| Tree `selection` | `modelValue` / `defaultValue` |
| Emoji size picker `sizeRatio` | `modelValue` |
| Disclosure `isOpen` and alternate open notifications | `open` / `defaultOpen` / `update:open` |
| Independently writable secondary state | Named `v-model`, such as `v-model:page` or `v-model:zoom` |

An absent controlled Boolean stays absent so its uncontrolled seed can apply. `defaultValue` and
`defaultOpen` seed uncontrolled state; use the matching model prop/event pair for controlled state.
Stateless item keys, read-only display values and visibility flags do not become primary models.
ColorArea retains independent HSV `saturation` and `value` axes. SelectPicker emits the selected key
through `update:modelValue`; its former option-object `value-change` event is removed.
Named model axes include `inputValue`, `editing`, `view`, `mode`, `date`, `currentStep`, `sidebarOpen`,
`page`, `zoom`, `index`, `sortBy`, `expanded`, `nodes` and `sizes`; consult each adjacent component spec.

## Completed operations

House operations use `Result<TSuccess, TFailure>`:

```ts
const result = await copyText('Example');
if (!result.ok) {
  handleClipboardFailure(result.failure);
}
```

Read successful values from `result.value`. Browser failure categories are under `result.failure.status`.
Clipboard reads return strings/items, media acquisition returns MediaStream, notifications return Notification,
geolocation returns Position, and wake-lock acquisition returns its handle.
Void operations return `value: undefined` on success. Share-or-copy returns `shared` or `copied`.
Reactive controls keep explicit pending/current state; a permission-state read is not a completed-operation Result.

Native validators use the shared Result. Third-party Standard Schema still uses its standard
`{ value } | { issues }` protocol. Do not wrap that protocol when passing a schema to a vendor.

## HTTP and query

HTTP returns `Result<unknown, ApiFailure>` for raw JSON. Typed data requires an explicit decoder.
Empty responses require `response: 'empty'`; callers cannot claim arbitrary successful data after a 204.
Use `response: 'text'`, `response: 'blob'` or `response: 'arrayBuffer'` for non-JSON bodies.
Set request `json` to a codec to override the client default, or to `null` to use native JSON for that request.
The global temporal reviver and unchecked `parseJson<T>` are removed: field schemas own dates,
durations, numeric precision, enum values and omission/null behavior.

`TemporalCodecs` from `foundation/datetime` provides named `instant`, `plainDate`, `plainTime`,
`isoDuration` and `clrTimeSpan` field codecs. Each has `decode(unknown)` and `encode(value)` methods
returning Result. CLR TimeSpan uses its constant wire format with exact 100 ns ticks; ISO duration
retains its separate calendar semantics. Neither codec inspects unrelated JSON fields.

Query callbacks return Result. The adapter rejects expected failures only at TanStack's internal boundary;
house mutation and lazy-fetch APIs return Result. Suspense follows Vue's error-boundary rejection protocol.
Supply the QueryClient explicitly to prefetch helpers; there is no shared default client.

## Auth and forms

Auth strategies and actions return Result. Bearer token exchanges return `BearerCredentials`;
logout clears local credentials immediately. Default redirect return URLs are application-local paths.
An explicit custom URL builder owns any alternate redirect trust policy.

Forms distinguish editing input from parsed output. `onSubmit` receives the parsed snapshot and returns
`Promise<Result<unknown>>`; `handleSubmit` returns the boolean submission verdict, with typed failure
available in state. Reset uses the current baseline; successful submissions advance it without replacing
newer editing values. Autosave coalesces later edits into a trailing save.

`onSubmit` receives a second `{ signal }` context; forward it to the transport. `cancelSubmit()` cancels
the current intent, while `invalidateSession(next?)` replaces session-owned form state. A transport
ignoring abort cannot restore obsolete form state; cancellation does not promise server rollback.
`validate({ fields?, schema? })` supports step gates; final submission always uses the whole configured
schema. Manual submissions focus the first invalid field or an error summary; imperative calls can
provide `focusRoot`.

The generic storage `useAutosave` serializes writes and retains the latest trailing intent. It accepts
void storage sinks and explicit Result sinks. Disposal cancels pending work rather than starting a hidden
write. `flush()` readies pending work and does not await durability; cancellation cannot undo a started sink.

`LocaleProvider` defaults to `en-US` on both server and client. Pass the same request locale to both;
apply browser preferences explicitly after hydration.

Use `formatExactNumber` or `createLocaleFormatters(locale).exactNumber` for exact decimal display.
Use the strict `exactNumber()` validator after a lossless JSON boundary; it rejects native numbers,
strings and bigints rather than guessing whether their original wire token was precise.

`useFieldArray<TUnion>().variant(guard)` returns a guarded branch view. Check `matches(row.index)`
before rendering its narrowed `Field`; the guard is re-evaluated against the current row value.

`Navbar` accepts `containerAttrs` and `containerClass` for its inner `ContainerLayout`. `Card` accepts
`ambient="sheen"`, `ambient="glow"` or `ambient="bevel"`; the package stylesheet owns those treatments.

## Renamed public types

| Previous type | Current type |
|---|---|
| `UseWorkerResult` | `UseWorkerControls` |
| `UseUploadQueueResult` | `UseUploadQueueControls` |
| `AppQueryResult` | `AppQueryControls` |
| `MountWithQueryResult` | `MountWithQueryControls` |
| `RunWithQueryResult` | `RunWithQueryControls` |
| Credential exchange result | `BearerCredentials` |
| Router guard result | `GuardDecision` |
| `PositionResult` | `PositionReadResult` |
| `MediaStreamResult` | `MediaStreamRequestResult` |
| `NotifyResult` | `NotificationShowResult` |
| `ShareResult` | `ShareSendResult` |
| `ShareOrCopyResult` | `ShareSendOrCopyResult` |
| `SpeakResult` | `SpeechSpeakResult` |
| Native `ValidationResult` | `ValidatorParseResult` |
| `RunInWorkerResult` | `WorkerRunResult` |
| `ScreenResult`, `ScreenValueResult<T>` | `ScreenRequestResult<T = void>` |
| `CommandRunOutcome` | `CommandRunResult` |
| `NotifyFailure` | `NotificationFailure` |
| `SpeakFailure` | `SpeechFailure` |
| `RunInWorkerFailure` | `WorkerRunFailure` |

## Theme contrast

Generated and authored themes now validate ordinary text, placeholders, translucent treatments and control
indicators against their declared host surfaces. Foreground, input-border and strong-border tokens changed;
branded fills, backgrounds and decorative borders remain unchanged. The default stylesheet has matching fixes.

`smart-qr` is now a candidate because its corrected foregrounds have not been visually revalidated in the
product. All 183 shipped themes pass the declared contrast pairs; this does not prove every possible custom
background, class override or component composition accessible. Application/custom backgrounds still need
their own rendered checks.

## Component family moves

Both the public name and group may change. Named compound subparts follow their renamed root;
native HTML tags, ARIA strings and independent domain enums keep their platform/domain spelling.

## Core optimization corrections

This batch corrects beta APIs without compatibility aliases. There are no production consumers.

| API | Current contract |
| --- | --- |
| `ExactNumber` instance methods | Methods use their receiver. Use `values.map(value => value.toString())`, not a detached method reference. Values remain frozen and comparisons/arithmetic remain exact. |
| `ExactNumber` transport | Native `structuredClone`, worker messages and IndexedDB structured cloning reject exact values. Use `LosslessJson` text to retain numeric tokens; ordinary JSON stringifies exact values as strings. |
| Generic value equality | Direct exact numeric values compare numerically. Shallow comparison of containing objects still compares their property values by identity. |
| `buildTree` | Each input produces one node. Duplicate IDs resolve children to the first matching owner; cycles are exposed as roots instead of recursing forever. |
| `mapTree` | Cyclic node graphs throw `TypeError`; arbitrarily deep acyclic trees use iterative traversal. |
| `maskString` visibility | Only nonnegative integer counts are valid. Invalid counts mask the whole string instead of exposing it. |
| `slugify` separator | A literal string, including empty strings and replacement/regex metacharacters. |
| `provideLocale` messages | A function is a translator value. Use a ref/computed for a changing translator; a getter returning another translator is not interpreted implicitly. |
| `QueryProvider.client` | Captured for the provider subtree lifetime. Remount the provider to switch clients. |
| `usePolling` | Accepts a direct callback or a ref holding one. Reactive indirection can use `usePolling(() => currentCallback.value())`. |
| `MaxBreakpoints` | Removed. Every entry in the supplied scale receives a listener. |
| Upload queue removal/clear | Abort requests immediately, but occupied slots remain until transports settle. Custom transports must honor their `AbortSignal`. |
| Form dirty state | Files/Blobs compare by identity; matching metadata does not establish matching bytes. |
| Theme enumeration | `ThemeCatalog` exposes lightweight declared metadata; `getTheme` generates only the requested candidate. Iterating `THEMES` still materializes all entries. |

The three legacy React apps received app-only corrections. The React library API is unchanged by this optimization batch.

## Verification

Run `pnpm typecheck`, `pnpm lint`, `pnpm format:check`, `pnpm test`, `pnpm build` and
`pnpm check:package --install`. The final command installs the actual packed package in a fresh consumer.
Use adjacent component specifications and the playground for current props, slots and behavior.
