/*
 * The port's camelization rule, as a standing guard.
 *
 * Vue camelizes declared prop keys, so a `'aria-label'` listed in `defineProps` arrives as
 * `props.ariaLabel`, is stripped out of `attrs`, and — unless the template happens to read the
 * camel spelling — renders nowhere, leaving the control with no accessible name. Every
 * component below deliberately keeps `aria-label` OUT of its declared props and reads it off
 * `attrs` instead; these assertions are what stop that from being quietly undone.
