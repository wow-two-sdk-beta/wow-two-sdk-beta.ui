// The sink seam — one method between the logger and wherever records actually go (console, an HTTP
// shipper, Sentry, a test double).
//
// `write` is synchronous and returns nothing, unlike `AnalyticsProvider`'s promise-tolerant methods. A
// logger is called from `catch` blocks and unhandled-rejection handlers where there is nobody left to await
// a result, so a batching sink owns its own queue and flush schedule rather than handing the logger a
// promise it would have to drop on the floor anyway.
//
// A sink MAY throw — it is third-party code on a non-critical path. The logger wraps every call and routes
// the failure to `onError`, so one broken sink never stops the others in the fan-out and never reaches the
// caller.
