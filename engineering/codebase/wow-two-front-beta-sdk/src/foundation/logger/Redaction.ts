// Redaction runs on the way IN — inside the logger, before the record reaches any sink — rather than
// inside each sink. A sink is third-party code that may ship off the device, so a secret that reaches one
// has already leaked; asking every adapter to redact is asking for the one that forgets.
//
// Decisions:
//
// - **Keys match case-insensitively; matched values are dropped whole.** `Authorization` / `authorization`
//   / `AUTHORIZATION` are the same header. A partial mask (`sk-…f31a`) still leaks a prefix and invites a
//   per-call-site judgement about whether that is enough, so the value is replaced regardless of its type —
//   a matched key whose value is an object does not get walked.
// - **The walk copies; it never mutates.** The caller's object is theirs and is very often live
//   application state — redacting in place would erase a real token from a real session, which is exactly
//   the kind of damage a logger must never do.
// - **Recursion covers arrays and PLAIN objects only.** `Object.keys(new Date())` is empty, so walking a
//   `Date` / `Map` / `URL` / class instance would silently replace it with `{}`. Everything non-plain
//   passes through by reference — worth knowing, because a secret held on a class instance is NOT redacted.
//
// The input is assumed hostile, because a context object is assembled at a call site that may itself be
// mid-failure: a cycle is cut with `CircularMarker`, a throwing getter or `ownKeys` trap yields
// `UnreadableMarker`, and depth is capped at `DefaultMaxRedactDepth`. The cap is fail-CLOSED — the subtree
// becomes `TruncatedMarker` rather than passing through unredacted — and it is what keeps a pathological
// graph from overflowing the stack, which is the one way this could otherwise break its no-throw contract.
//
// Cycles are tracked along the current PATH (added before descending, removed after), not globally, so a
// value legitimately referenced by several siblings still renders each time instead of the second and later
// occurrences reading as circular.
