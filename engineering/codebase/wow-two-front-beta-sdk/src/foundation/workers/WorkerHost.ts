// THE SCOPE IS STRUCTURALLY TYPED, NOT `DedicatedWorkerGlobalScope`. That type ships in TypeScript's
// `webworker` lib, and this package compiles under `["ES2022", "DOM", "DOM.Iterable"]` — pulling in
// `webworker` alongside `DOM` is not an option, since the two declare conflicting globals (`self`,
// `postMessage`, `location`) and the merge fails outright. A minimal structural `WorkerScope` describes
// exactly the three members used and typechecks under either lib. It also makes the host injectable, which
// is what lets a test drive both halves without a real worker.
//
// THE DEFAULT SCOPE IS RESOLVED, NOT ASSUMED. `globalThis` in a window is a `Window`, whose `postMessage`
// has a different signature (`targetOrigin`) — so the default is probed for the two members it needs and
// yields `null` when absent. Calling this on the main thread or under SSR therefore registers nothing and
// returns a no-op disposer instead of throwing. Importing a worker module from the main thread is a
// routine accident (a barrel re-export, a bundler pulling it into the wrong chunk); it should be inert,
// not fatal.
//
// EVERY FAILURE PATH MUST STILL POST A REPLY. A handler that throws, a method that does not exist, a
// rejected promise, and even a RESULT THAT WILL NOT CLONE all have to produce a `{ id, error }` message,
// because the client's pending entry is keyed on that id and only a reply (or its deadline) releases it.
// The non-cloneable result is the subtle one: posting the success throws inside the host, and without the
// second try/catch around it the call would hang until its timeout — or forever, if it has none.

 * a large payload is the difference between a frame and a stall.
 *
