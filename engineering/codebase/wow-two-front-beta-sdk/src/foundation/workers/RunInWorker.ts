// One-shot offloading: run a self-contained function on another thread without authoring a worker file,
// wiring it into the bundler, or keeping a thread alive afterwards. For the one expensive pure computation
// that would otherwise block a frame — a hash over a large buffer, a sort of a hundred thousand rows,
// parsing a big CSV.
//
// THE FUNCTION IS STRINGIFIED, SO IT CANNOT CLOSE OVER ANYTHING. This is the constraint that makes or
// breaks every use of this helper, and it fails at RUNTIME, inside the other thread, with a bare
// `ReferenceError` naming a variable that is plainly in scope at the call site:
//
//   const factor = 2;
//   await runInWorker((n: number) => n * factor, [21]);   // ✗ ReferenceError: factor is not defined
//   await runInWorker((n: number, f: number) => n * f, [21, 2]); // ✓ everything arrives through args
//
// `Function.prototype.toString` returns source text, not a closure. The text is embedded in a `Blob` and
// evaluated in a scope that shares nothing with the module it was written in — no captured variables, no
// imports, no `document`, no React. Everything the function needs must arrive through `args`, and `args`
// must survive structured clone. The same rule voids TypeScript's help here: the compiler happily
// typechecks the captured variable it is about to strip.
//
// The mirror-image trap is the METHOD SHORTHAND. `({ work(n) { ... } }).work.toString()` yields
// `work(n) { ... }`, which is not a valid expression even wrapped in parentheses, and the worker dies on a
// syntax error. Pass a function expression or an arrow.
//
// THE BLOB URL IS REVOKED IN A `finally`. Each `createObjectURL` pins its blob in memory until revoked,
// and a revoke skipped on the failure path is a leak that only shows up in the runs that already went
// wrong. The worker is terminated there too, on every path.
//
// The result is a discriminated union rather than a throw, matching `foundation/share`'s idiom: an
// unsupported runtime (SSR, or a CSP without `worker-src blob:`) is a fact to branch on, not an exception,
// and it must be distinguishable from the function itself failing.
