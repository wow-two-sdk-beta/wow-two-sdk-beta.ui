// The wire format both halves of the RPC agree on, kept in one dependency-free module so the client and
// the host can never drift apart, and so the parts worth testing without a browser (id allocation, the
// shape guards) are testable in the node project.
//
// TWO DECISIONS HERE ARE NOT OBVIOUS.
//
// 1. EVERY MESSAGE CARRIES A CHANNEL TAG. A `Worker` is a single shared `postMessage` pipe, not a private
//    one: the same worker may also carry a consumer's own hand-written traffic, a bundler's HMR ping, or
//    another library's protocol. Without a tag, a guard keyed only on `typeof id === 'number'` would
//    happily adopt a foreign message and resolve — or worse, reject — an unrelated call. So both guards
//    demand the tag first, and anything unrecognized is IGNORED rather than treated as an error: a message
//    that isn't ours is not a protocol violation, it is someone else's message.
//
// 2. SUCCESS AND FAILURE ARE SPLIT BY AN EXPLICIT `ok` FLAG, not by probing for an `error` key. `undefined`
//    is a legitimate result — a handler returning nothing must still resolve, not be misread as a failure
//    because its `result` member is absent after a structured-clone round trip. The boolean makes the
//    union genuinely discriminated and keeps `void` methods working.
//
// The error side of the wire is a `SerializedError` from `foundation/errors`, not an `Error`: structured
// clone drops `stack` and the subclass, so an `Error` posted directly arrives as a bare object with only
// `message` intact. `serializeError` flattens it to plain JSON-safe members (including the `cause` chain)
// and the client feeds that back through `toError` on the far side.
