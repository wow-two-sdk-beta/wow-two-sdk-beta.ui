// Signed distance between two dates, in whole units.
//
// ARGUMENT ORDER is `(from, to)` and the result is POSITIVE when `to` is later — the same order the
// existing `daysBetween`/`minutesBetween` helpers in `presentation/forms/DateExtensions` already use.
// Note this is the REVERSE of `date-fns`, whose `differenceInDays(dateLeft, dateRight)` computes
// left − right; the parameter names are the reminder.
//
// TRUNCATION, never rounding: a partial trailing unit does not count, and truncation is toward zero, so
// `differenceInX(a, b) === -differenceInX(b, a)` holds for every unit. 25 hours apart = 1 day; 23 hours
// apart = 0 days. The one exception is internal: the day/week calculation rounds the raw millisecond
// quotient because a DST day is 23 or 25 hours long and would otherwise truncate to a day short — both
// endpoints are snapped to local start-of-day first, so what is being rounded is a whole-day quantity
// that only DST perturbed. That makes day differences CALENDAR-day differences: Mar 15 23:00 → Mar 16
// 01:00 is 1 day apart, not 0, which is what a calendar UI means by "1 day".
//
// Month/year differences are calendar-based and agree with `addMonths` clamping: Jan 31 → Feb 28 is a
// full 1 month, because `addMonths(Jan 31, 1)` lands exactly on Feb 28.
