// Date ranges — the primitives a calendar grid, a range picker, and a scheduling view are built from.
//
// A REVERSED range is EMPTY across this whole slice (same rule as `isBetween`): `eachDayOfInterval`
// returns `[]`, `isWithinInterval` and `overlaps` return `false`. The bounds are never swapped for you —
// a reversed range is a caller bug, and normalizing it would return a plausible answer that hides it.
// Invalid dates behave the same way, so neither function can spin: the loop guard compares against `NaN`
// and exits immediately.
//
// The two membership tests use DIFFERENT bound semantics on purpose, because they answer different
// questions:
//  - `isWithinInterval` is a POINT-in-range test → bounds INCLUSIVE. "Is this day inside the selected
//    range" must count the first and last day of the selection.
//  - `overlaps` is an INTERVAL-vs-INTERVAL test → bounds HALF-OPEN `[start, end)` by default. Two
//    back-to-back meetings (09:00-10:00 and 10:00-11:00) do not conflict, which is the answer every
//    scheduler wants. Pass `{ inclusive: true }` for closed-range semantics, where a shared endpoint
//    does count as an overlap.
