// Interval polling that stops burning quota when nobody is looking.
//
// WHY A HIDDEN TAB MUST NOT POLL: a background tab is invisible, not closed. A 10-second poll left running
// across a workday is thousands of requests nobody will ever see the result of — paid for in the user's
// battery, the user's mobile data, and the API's rate limit, which is then unavailable to the tab the user is
// actually looking at. Browsers throttle background timers, but throttling is not stopping: the requests
// still go out, just less punctually. So this suspends on `visibilitychange` and, by default, refreshes
// immediately on return, since data that went stale while hidden is the first thing the returning user reads.
//
// WHY OFFLINE MUST NOT POLL: every tick during an outage is a guaranteed failure. Left running it produces a
// stream of errors that drowns the log, trips error-rate alerting, and — where the poll feeds a UI — flickers
// a failure banner on a schedule. Suspending costs nothing, because the `online` event fires the moment there
// is anything to poll for.
//
// SUSPENSION IS REASON-COUNTED, NOT A BOOLEAN, and this is the non-obvious part. Three independent things can
// suspend the poller — the caller's `pause()`, a hidden tab, an offline browser — and with one flag they
// overwrite each other: the tab regains focus, clears the flag, and silently resumes a poller the CALLER
// paused, which is a real bug (a modal that paused polling reopens to a poller running behind it). A set of
// reasons makes the rule exact: the poller ticks only when the set is empty, and `resume()` clears only the
// caller's reason.
//
// TICKS DO NOT OVERLAP. Scheduling is a `setTimeout` CHAIN, re-armed after each run settles, not a
// `setInterval`. With an interval, a poll slower than its period stacks: requests overlap, responses arrive
// out of order, and the slowest response wins the UI — worse the more congested the network is, which is
// exactly when it hurts. The chain makes `intervalMs` the gap BETWEEN runs, so a slow backend degrades to
// polling less often instead of DDoSing itself.
//
// CONNECTIVITY IS READ THROUGH `Liveness.ts`, whose header explains why this slice has a non-React reader at
// all instead of `foundation/device`'s `useOnlineStatus`.
