// Server-Sent Events with typed named-event handlers and a reconnect that does NOT fight the browser's own.
//
// THE DOUBLE-RECONNECT TRAP, which is the whole reason this wrapper is subtle. `EventSource` already
// reconnects by itself: on an ordinary drop the browser sets `readyState` back to `CONNECTING`, waits out its
// own delay (the server can set it with a `retry:` field), and re-opens the SAME `EventSource` object. It
// fires `error` while doing so. So the naive wrapper — "on error, make a new `EventSource`" — ends up with
// TWO live connections for one drop: the browser's retry on the old object, plus the wrapper's new one. Each
// subsequent drop doubles again. The symptom is duplicated events and a server that sees connection counts
// climb, never a thrown error, which is why this ships to production so often.
//
// HOW THIS AVOIDS IT: the `error` handler branches on `source.readyState`, which is the only signal that
// distinguishes the two cases.
//   - `CONNECTING` (0) — the browser owns this retry and is already running it. The wrapper arms NO timer and
//     builds NO `EventSource`; it only reports the error with `owner: 'browser'` and shows `reconnecting`.
//   - `CLOSED` (2) — the browser has given up for good (a non-2xx response, a wrong content type, a bad
//     CORS preflight; none of these are retried by the spec). Only here does the wrapper take over: it
//     detaches its listeners, closes the dead object, and schedules a fresh connect on `resilience` backoff.
// The two owners are therefore mutually exclusive by construction, and `ReconnectOwner` reports which one is
// acting so a consumer can log it. The scheduler's own stacking guard backstops the invariant.
//
// WHY THE FATAL CASE STILL RETRIES AT ALL: the browser abandons the stream on a 502 from a proxy that is
// restarting, or on the 401 that follows an expired token — both routinely fix themselves. Leaving the page
// permanently dead because a gateway blinked is worse than a bounded reconnect, and a caller who disagrees
// passes `retry: false`.
//
// NAMED EVENTS ARE A MAP, NOT A SWITCH. A server sending `event: order-updated` delivers to a listener
// registered for that exact name, and NOT to `onmessage` — a detail that silently breaks the "I subscribed to
// onMessage but receive nothing" case. `options.events` registers one real listener per key, and the generic
// parameter types each payload independently.
