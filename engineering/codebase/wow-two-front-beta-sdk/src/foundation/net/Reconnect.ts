// The one place in this slice that decides WHEN to reconnect — and it decides nothing itself. Every delay
// comes from `foundation/resilience`'s `computeRetryDelay`, and every "should we even try again" answer comes
// from its `shouldRetry`. That slice owns retry POLICY (growth, jitter, cap, attempt budget); this scheduler
// owns only the timer and the attempt counter. Changing how backoff behaves means editing `resilience`, never
// this file — the same split `foundation/async`'s `retryAsync` follows.
//
// WHY A SHARED SCHEDULER RATHER THAN A `setTimeout` IN EACH TRANSPORT: both `createEventStream` and
// `createSocketClient` need identical bookkeeping — the attempt count, the previous delay (decorrelated
// jitter is a function of it), a cancellable handle, and a reset on success. Written twice they drift, and
// the half that drifts is always the reset: a client that forgets to zero its counter after a successful
// reconnect spends the rest of the session waiting the maximum delay after every blip.
//
// THE STACKING GUARD IS THE LOAD-BEARING PART. `schedule()` refuses to arm a second timer while one is
// pending. Both transports can be told about the same failure through more than one path — a WebSocket that
// errors then closes fires BOTH handlers, and an `EventSource` can report an error while a retry is already
// waiting — and without this guard each path arms its own timer, so a single drop produces two connections.
// Two sockets both "work", which is why this bug survives review: the symptom is duplicated messages and a
// doubled server load, not an obvious failure.
//
// `shouldRetry` IS QUERIED WITH STATUS `0`. It grades HTTP statuses, and a dropped stream has none — `0` is
// exactly the "network / unknown" code `resilience` reserves for that, and it is a member of
// `DefaultTransientStatuses`, so a default policy treats a drop as transient. A caller who genuinely wants a
// stream that never reconnects passes `retry: false` rather than fighting the status vocabulary.

 *
 * Differs from `DefaultRetryPolicy` in two ways that matter for a STREAM rather than a request. Attempts are
 * unbounded because a stream's failure mode is a server restart or a laptop lid, and giving up after two
 * tries leaves a dead page that no amount of waiting fixes — a request can surface an error to the caller,
 * a background stream has nobody to tell. And the jitter is `Equal`, not `Full`: full jitter can pick a delay
 * near zero, so a single client reconnecting to a flapping server hammers it immediately, whereas equal
 * jitter guarantees a floor of half the computed delay while still spreading a whole fleet apart.
