// Connectivity as a NON-REACT signal, for the factories in this slice that are plain functions and cannot
// call a hook.
//
// RELATIONSHIP TO `foundation/device`'s `useOnlineStatus` — READ BEFORE ADDING ANOTHER TRACKER. That hook is
// and remains THE React binding for connectivity; nothing here replaces it, and a component must keep using
// it. But `createPoller` and `waitForOnline` are framework-agnostic factories called from timers, effects,
// and `catch` blocks, where a hook is illegal. `device` keeps its reader module-private, so the choice was to
// export a reader from `device` (widening a slice this one has no business editing, and one another lane may
// be touching) or to keep a five-line reader here. This is the five-line reader, and it MIRRORS the hook's
// semantics deliberately: same optimistic default, same guarded read, same two events. If either changes,
// change both.
//
// WHAT `navigator.onLine` IS WORTH, restated because every caller gets this wrong: `false` is trustworthy
// (the browser knows there is no link); `true` only means a link exists — a captive portal, a dead VPN, or a
// server that is simply down all report `true`. So this drives "stop polling, nothing can succeed" and
// "wait before retrying", never "we are online, therefore this will work".
//
// `waitForOnline` RESOLVES A VERDICT AND NEVER THROWS, which is a deliberate deviation from `withTimeout` in
// `foundation/async` (that one rejects with a `TimeoutError`). Every call site for this function is ALREADY
// inside a failure path — a mutation just failed and the caller is deciding whether to retry. Rejecting
// there forces a nested try/catch around the recovery logic to distinguish "still offline" from a real
// fault, and a missed catch turns a recoverable failure into an unhandled rejection. A boolean reads as the
// question actually being asked: `if (await waitForOnline({ timeoutMs: 5_000 })) retry();`.
