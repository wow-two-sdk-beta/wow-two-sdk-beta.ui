// Feature detection for BOTH halves of the speech vector, kept in one file because the two answers are
// independent and a consumer that assumes otherwise ships a broken button. Firefox synthesizes speech perfectly
// and recognizes none; a page in a sandboxed iframe can have neither. `getSpeechSupport()` therefore reports two
// booleans, never one.
//
// Every read goes through an `unknown` cast rather than the DOM lib's `declare var speechSynthesis: SpeechSynthesis`
// — outside a browser that global is genuinely missing, so the typed view is a lie this module must not act on.
// The same posture as `foundation/media`'s `isKnownInsecureContext`.
//
// SYNTHESIS NEEDS TWO GLOBALS, not one. `speechSynthesis` is the controller and `SpeechSynthesisUtterance` is the
// value it speaks; a page with the first and not the second (a partial polyfill, a stripped webview) would pass a
// naive `'speechSynthesis' in window` check and then throw on `new SpeechSynthesisUtterance(...)` inside a click
// handler. `canSpeak()` requires both.
//
// RECOGNITION IS PREFIXED. Chrome and Safari expose `webkitSpeechRecognition`; the unprefixed name exists in
// newer Chrome. Both are checked, unprefixed first. Firefox exposes neither and is not a bug to work around —
// there is no polyfill short of shipping audio to a server yourself.
