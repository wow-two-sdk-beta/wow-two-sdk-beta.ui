// THE most common bug in this API, and the reason this file exists: `speechSynthesis.getVoices()` returns an
// EMPTY ARRAY on first call. The voice list is populated asynchronously — Chrome fetches remote voices, and every
// engine loads them off the main thread — so a component that renders `getVoices()` on mount renders an empty
// picker, forever, because nothing re-renders it when the list lands. The signal is a `voiceschanged` event, and
// the fix a consumer eventually writes by hand is exactly `listVoices`.
//
// `listVoices` therefore returns a PROMISE that waits for the list, with three subtleties the naive version
// misses, each of which turns the wait back into an empty array:
//  1. `voiceschanged` can fire with the list STILL empty. Chrome fires it once during initialization before any
//     voice is registered. Resolving there hands back exactly the empty array this function exists to avoid, so
//     an empty payload is ignored and the wait continues.
//  2. Some engines never fire the event at all — they simply populate the list a few hundred milliseconds in.
//     The timeout therefore RE-READS `getVoices()` rather than resolving with what it had at subscribe time, so a
//     silent late population still lands.
//  3. The wait must be bounded. On a device with genuinely no voices the event never comes, and an unbounded
//     promise would hang the component that awaited it. `DefaultVoicesTimeoutMs` bounds it and resolves with
//     whatever exists — possibly nothing, which is a truthful answer a UI can render.
//
// The subscription supports BOTH wiring styles. Older WebKit exposes only the `onvoiceschanged` property and no
// `addEventListener` for it; where the property is used, the previous handler is chained and restored on
// unsubscribe rather than clobbered, so this slice cannot silently break a consumer's own listener.
//
// Language matching lives here too (`voicesForLang`), because "the voices for this locale" is what a caller
// actually wants and BCP-47 tags do not compare with `===`: a `de` request must match a `de-DE` voice, and engines
// report tags in mixed case and occasionally with an underscore (`en_US`).
