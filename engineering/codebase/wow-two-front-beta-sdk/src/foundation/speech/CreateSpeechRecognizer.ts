// The recognition instance, wrapped so a consumer never touches the prefixed global, never gets a raw event, and
// never has a call throw at it.
//
// DEFINING CONTRACT: NOTHING HERE THROWS. That matters more here than anywhere else in the slice, because the
// native `start()` throws `InvalidStateError` for the most ordinary mistake there is — pressing the mic button
// twice. `start()` returns `already-started` for that, and every other call is guarded.
//
// STATE IS TRACKED IN THREE VALUES, not two. `starting` exists because `start()` returns long before the engine
// is listening: the `start` event arrives after the browser has (possibly) prompted for the microphone and opened
// the audio device. A two-state flag would report `idle` during that window and let a second `start()` through,
// straight into the `InvalidStateError` this wrapper exists to prevent.
//
// EVERY CONSUMER CALLBACK IS INVOKED THROUGH `report`, which swallows a throw. These callbacks run inside the
// browser's own event dispatch, where an exception becomes an unhandled error in the page with no relation to the
// code that caused it — the same reason `foundation/share`'s `reportShareError` exists.
//
// NO AUTO-RESTART, deliberately. With `continuous: true` Chrome still ends the session after a stretch of
// silence, and the obvious fix is restarting inside `onend`. That loop is a trap: it re-opens the microphone
// indefinitely, keeps Chrome streaming audio to a remote service, and turns a `denied` into a hot loop of denials.
// The session ends, `onEnd` fires, and the consumer decides.
//
// PRIVACY, stated plainly because a wrapper this convenient hides it: in Chrome, recognition is NOT on-device.
// Audio is sent to a Google server and the transcript comes back. Anything spoken into this API leaves the
// machine. Safari's implementation differs, and Firefox has none at all.
