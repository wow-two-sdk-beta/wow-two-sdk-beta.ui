// Search + ranking — the pure half of a palette's filter box. Kept out of the registry so any list can be ranked
// (a static array, a scoped subset, an app set merged with the SDK's) without owning a registry, and so the
// ranking is testable without mounting anything.
//
// Non-obvious decisions:
// - Matching covers `title`, `keywords`, and `group` only. `description` is deliberately excluded: a sentence-long
//   description matches almost any short query, which floods the list and destroys the ranking.
// - Ranking is tiered, not fuzzy. Fuzzy scoring reorders rows unpredictably as the user types; four ordered tiers
//   (title prefix → title substring → keyword → group) stay legible and cheap.
// - Ties keep the caller's original order — the sort is explicitly stabilized on the source index rather than
//   relying on engine sort stability, so a palette's rows never reshuffle between keystrokes.
// - An empty (or whitespace-only) query returns the SAME array reference it was given, so a `useMemo`d caller
//   doesn't churn on the common "nothing typed yet" path.
