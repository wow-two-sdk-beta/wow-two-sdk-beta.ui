// The channel factory and its three transports. One dispatch path serves all of them, which is the whole point:
// the receiving RULES (drop your own message, drop a duplicate, never let a listener's throw escape) live here
// once, and a transport only has to move bytes.
//
// TRANSPORT LADDER (`auto`): `BroadcastChannel` → `storage` event → inert. Each rung is strictly weaker than the
// one above, and a rung that is unavailable falls through instead of throwing — an explicit `transport:
// 'broadcast'` in a browser without it still yields a working channel, just a lesser one.
//
// THE `storage` FALLBACK IS A GENUINE DOWNGRADE, not a polyfill. Its known weaknesses, all inherent:
//   - JSON only. The envelope round-trips through `StorageBroker`, so a `Map`, `Set`, `Date`, `undefined`,
//     cyclic object, or `ArrayBuffer` does not survive — `BroadcastChannel` structured-clones all of those.
//   - Same-origin only, like `localStorage` itself. (`BroadcastChannel` is also same-origin, so this one is a
//     wash — stated because consumers ask.)
//   - One key, last write wins. Two posts inside a single task collapse: the second overwrites the first before
//     any peer's `storage` handler has run, and the first is simply lost. Bursty publishers should batch.
//   - Delivery is best-effort and unordered across senders; there is no ack and no queue.
//   - The last envelope is left in storage on purpose. Removing it would fire a second `storage` event in every
//     peer for no payload, and nothing reads the key on join.
//   - Blocked storage (Safari private mode, a sandboxed iframe, quota) degrades the write to a silent no-op —
//     the broker already swallows it, so the channel simply delivers nothing.
//
// WHY `post` HAS A `try`: `BroadcastChannel.postMessage` throws `DataCloneError` for a payload the structured
// clone algorithm rejects — a function, a DOM node, a class instance with a live handle. That is the one place
// a caller could otherwise be surprised by a throw from this slice, and the contract says nothing here throws.
