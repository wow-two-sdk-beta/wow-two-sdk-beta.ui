// The one field-reading seam shared by the sort and filter models. Both answer the same question —
// "given an item and a field name, what value do I compare?" — so the vocabulary lives here rather than
// being defined twice and drifting.
//
// Accessors are OPTIONAL by design: the overwhelmingly common table column sorts on a plain property, so
// `readField` falls back to a direct property read when no accessor is registered for the field. That
// keeps the zero-config call (`applySort(rows, [{ field: 'name', direction: 'asc' }])`) working while
// still letting a computed column (`fullName`, `total`) register a real accessor.
//
// The map is `Partial` on purpose: with `noUncheckedIndexedAccess` a `Partial<Record<TField, F>>` lookup
// is `F | undefined` for BOTH a `string` field type and a literal union, so the guard below type-checks
// identically either way — no cast, no `any`.
