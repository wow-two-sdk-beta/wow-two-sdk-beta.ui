// selection — foundation seam. The canonical selection / sort / filter model for every list-shaped surface:
// pure immutable state machines plus thin React wrappers, with nothing rendered and nothing fetched.
//
// The vector exists because these three were being re-derived per component — a table grew a sort cycle, a
// listbox grew a selection set, a filter bar grew a comparator — and each copy quietly answered the hard
// questions differently: where nullish values land, whether shift-click replaces or unions, whether a third
// header click clears. Those answers are user-visible behaviour, so they belong in one tested model rather
// than in whichever component was written last.
//
// Layering: this slice is pure state + comparison. It knows nothing about rows, keyboards, or the DOM, so a
// virtualised grid, a server-driven table, and a headless test all drive the same model. Components are the
// CONSUMERS — the model never reaches back into `presentation`.
//
// Vocabulary is aligned with `foundation/http`'s `Page` / `TokenPage`: `SortDescriptor` and
// `FilterDescriptor` are the client-side shapes a product's `{Noun}QueryDto` echoes back through
// `IHasAppliedQuery`, so client-sorted and server-sorted surfaces speak one language.
//
// String ordering goes through `foundation/utils`' `compareStrings` (one cached `Intl.Collator`, numeric-
// aware). This slice adds no collator of its own — text must not order differently here than in a component.
