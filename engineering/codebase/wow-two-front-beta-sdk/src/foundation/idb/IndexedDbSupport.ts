// IndexedDB resolution + capability probes — the single place this slice reads the ambient
// `globalThis.indexedDB`. Isolated for the same two reasons as `foundation/crypto`'s `WebCrypto`, plus one
// that is specific to IndexedDB.
//
// 1. The global is read at CALL time, never cached at module scope. Caching would freeze an `undefined`
//    captured during SSR into the module for the page's lifetime, and would block a test from stubbing the
//    factory to exercise a failure path. This is also what keeps the slice import-safe under SSR: nothing
//    here runs until a caller asks.
// 2. Merely READING `globalThis.indexedDB` can throw. A sandboxed iframe without `allow-same-origin` raises
//    a `SecurityError` from the getter itself, so the read is inside a try/catch — a bare `in` check or a
//    `typeof` test would still throw there.
// 3. **Presence does not imply usability.** Firefox in private browsing exposes a complete `indexedDB`
//    object whose `open()` fails — historically a synchronous `InvalidStateError`, later an async `error`
//    event on the request. Some Safari/WebView builds behave similarly after a storage eviction. So a
//    structural check answers "is the API here?", NOT "does it work?", and the two need separate probes:
//      - `isIndexedDbAvailable()` — synchronous, structural, free. The fast gate.
//      - `probeIndexedDb()`       — asynchronous, functional: actually opens and deletes a throwaway
//                                   database. The only answer that is true in private mode.
//    A feature that must not half-work (an offline cache, a draft queue) should gate on the async probe
//    once at startup and cache the result; everything else can use the sync gate.
