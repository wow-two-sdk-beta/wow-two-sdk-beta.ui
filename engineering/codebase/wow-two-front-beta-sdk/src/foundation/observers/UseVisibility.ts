// `useVisibility` — HOW MUCH of an element is on screen, as a 0–1 number, where `useInView` answers only whether
// any of it is. Drives scroll-progress bars, parallax and scrub animations, "80% read" analytics, and volume or
// opacity that tracks how much of a player is showing.
//
// IT IS `useInView` WITH A GENERATED THRESHOLD LADDER, NOT A SECOND OBSERVER IMPLEMENTATION. The only real
// difference between the two hooks is how many thresholds the observer was built with — the lifecycle (ref
// identity changes, `once`, `disabled`, unsupported-fails-open, unmount teardown) is identical, and a second copy
// of it would be a second set of the subtle bugs that lifecycle exists to prevent. So the whole hook is: pick the
// ladder, delegate, read `intersectionRatio` off the entry.
//
// `threshold` IS DELIBERATELY NOT ACCEPTED. It is the one option this hook computes from `steps`; letting a
// caller pass both would mean silently ignoring one of them. `Omit`ing it makes that a compile error instead.
//
// THE RATIO IS READ FROM THE ENTRY, NOT ACCUMULATED. The browser already computed it; tracking it separately
// would drift the moment a callback is coalesced or arrives out of order.
