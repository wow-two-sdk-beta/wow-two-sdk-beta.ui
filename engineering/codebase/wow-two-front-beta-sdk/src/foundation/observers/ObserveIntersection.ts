// The React-free core of the intersection half of this slice. Every hook here is a thin lifecycle wrapper over
// `observeIntersection`, which means a router guard, an analytics probe, or a plain script can watch an element
// without pulling React in — and means the observer's own semantics are proven in one place rather than three.
//
// A DISPOSER, NOT AN OBSERVER, IS RETURNED. Handing back the `IntersectionObserver` would invite callers to keep
// observing other elements on it, and then a single `disconnect()` from one owner would silently stop everybody
// else's. A disposer is the smallest capability that still cleans up, and it is idempotent so a double-dispose
// (React strict-mode remount, a `finally` that also runs on the happy path) is not an error.
//
// ABSENT API ⇒ A NO-OP DISPOSER, NEVER A THROW. On the server there is no `IntersectionObserver` at all, and in a
// pre-2019 browser there is none either. Both are the same shape of problem — the element can never be reported
// as intersecting — so both take the same branch. Callers decide what "unknown visibility" means for them; see
// `fallbackInView` in `UseInView`, which fails OPEN so reveal-on-scroll content is never stranded invisible.
//
// THRESHOLDS ARE COPIED ON THE WAY IN. `IntersectionObserverInit.threshold` is a mutable `number[]` in lib.dom,
// but this slice accepts `readonly number[]` so a consumer can pass a frozen module constant. The copy is what
// bridges the two, and it also stops the browser from ever holding a reference to a caller's array.
