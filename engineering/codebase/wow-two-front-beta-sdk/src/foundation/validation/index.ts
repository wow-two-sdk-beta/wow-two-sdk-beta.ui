// validation — foundation seam. A small, dependency-free validator layer any slice can use: build a
// validator with `string()`, `object({…})`, `array(…)`, run it with `validate(value)`, and get back
// either the parsed value or every issue with its path. No React, no peer deps, no schema library.
//
// WHY IT EXISTS, GIVEN `forms-engine` ALREADY VALIDATES: `forms-engine` speaks Standard Schema, but the
// spec type lived THERE — above `foundation` in the layer graph. A config parser, a URL-param reader, or
// an API-payload check sits below that line and cannot import upward, so until now the only options were
// hand-rolling checks per call site or pulling a schema library into a package that ships zero runtime
// dependencies. This slice puts the vocabulary at the bottom of the graph, where everything can reach it.
//
// EVERY VALIDATOR IS A STANDARD SCHEMA. Each one exposes `['~standard']` per the v1 spec, so a validator
// built here is accepted unchanged by `forms-engine` (`AppFormOptions.schema`) or by any other spec
// consumer — the same object serves a boot-time config parse and a form. Nothing needs converting, and
// `runStandardSchema` in `forms-engine/SchemaValidation.ts` is NOT duplicated here; that plumbing folds
// spec issues into form-field errors and rightly stays in the forms layer.
//
// CHOOSING BETWEEN THIS AND A SCHEMA LIBRARY: zod / valibot / arktype remain optional CONSUMER peers and
// are the right call for a large, evolving domain schema. This slice covers the boundary checks the SDK
// itself performs, where adding a dependency to a zero-dependency package is not an option.
//
// THE CONTRACT: nothing here throws except `assertValid`, which throws only because the caller asked.
