// The WAAPI seam of the animation vector — one way to start an animation, one handle shape to control it.
//
// WHY a wrapper at all, when `element.animate()` already exists:
//
//  - THREE FAILURE MODES COLLAPSE INTO ONE PATH. A null element (SSR, an unattached ref), a host without WAAPI
//    (Safari < 13.1, jsdom), and a reduced-motion user all want the same outcome: the state change lands, the
//    tween does not. Each caller would otherwise re-derive that branch — and most would forget one of the three.
//
//  - `finished` NEVER REJECTS. The native `Animation.finished` promise rejects with an `AbortError` when the
//    animation is cancelled, so every `await` needs a try/catch and every un-awaited handle risks an unhandled
//    rejection. Here `finished` SETTLES — on finish, on cancel, or on browser removal — because the only thing
//    callers actually want to know is "the animation is no longer running, run cleanup". It resolves `void`; a
//    caller that must distinguish the two reads the element's state, not the promise.
//
//  - DURATION 0 IS THE REDUCED-MOTION CONTRACT. `reducedMotion: true` and `duration: 0` take the exact same
//    branch: commit the final keyframe synchronously and return a settled handle. Reduced motion means "skip the
//    tween", never "skip the state change" — an element that was going to end up opaque still ends up opaque.
//
// `reducedMotion` is an explicit OPTION, not a `useReducedMotion()` call inside. That keeps `animate` a pure
// function usable outside React (an imperative controller, a node test) and leaves exactly one place — the hook
// layer — that reads the media query. See `UseFlip.ts` for the React side that wires the two together.
