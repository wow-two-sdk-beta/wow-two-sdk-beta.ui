// FLIP — First, Last, Invert, Play. The technique for animating a layout change that the browser has already
// committed: snapshot the geometry BEFORE the change ("First"), let the change happen, measure again ("Last"),
// apply the transform that visually puts the element back where it was ("Invert"), then animate that transform
// away ("Play"). The element ends at its real layout position, and only compositor-cheap `transform` was
// animated — never `top`/`left`/`width`, which reflow every frame.
//
// NON-OBVIOUS DECISIONS:
//
//  - THE MATH IS SEPARATE FROM THE DOM. `computeFlipTransform` takes two plain rects and returns four numbers.
//    That is the whole algorithm, and it is exhaustively unit-testable in node with hand-built rects — no
//    browser, no layout engine, no flake. `measureRect` and `playFlip` are the thin DOM shell around it.
//
//  - `transform-origin: top left`. The translate is derived from the rects' top-left corners, so the scale must
//    pivot there too. With the CSS default (`50% 50%`) a scaled element drifts by half the size delta and the
//    inverted frame no longer overlays the original position — the single most common FLIP bug.
//
//  - NO INLINE INVERT, NO CLEANUP. The inverted transform is the FIRST KEYFRAME, not an inline style. A
//    play-pending WAAPI animation already applies its first frame in the next style recalc, so there is no
//    unstyled flash to guard against; and with `fill: 'none'` the element is left with ZERO inline residue when
//    the animation ends or is cancelled. The inline-then-clear variant has to race its own cleanup against a
//    paint at the end and can strand a `transform` on the node if the handle is dropped.
//
//  - DIVISION IS GUARDED, ALWAYS. A "last" rect of zero width/height is routine — a `display: none` ancestor,
//    an element measured mid-unmount, a collapsed flex child. Dividing by it yields `Infinity`, which becomes
//    `scale(Infinity)`, which WAAPI rejects. Every ratio here falls back to `1` unless it is finite.
