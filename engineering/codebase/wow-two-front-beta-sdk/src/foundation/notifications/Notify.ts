// The delivery half of the notification vector: one call, four outcomes, no throw.
//
// DEFINING CONTRACT: NOTHING HERE THROWS. This is called straight from a click handler or an effect, where a
// throw is an unhandled error in the consumer's app — and the user, whose tab is in the background, sees
// nothing at all. Every path resolves to a `NotifyResult` the caller switches on: a missing API, a missing
// grant, a constructor that rejects the payload, even a hostile options getter.
//
// Synchronous by design, unlike `foundation/share`'s `share`: `new Notification()` is a synchronous call, and
// returning the handle immediately is what lets a caller `close()` it, re-tag it, or keep it for later. The
// permission prompt is the async part of this vector and lives in `NotificationPermission.ts`.
//
// `default` and `denied` both come back as `denied`. Not-granted is not-shown either way, and the distinction
// that matters to a consumer — whether a prompt is still worth offering — is `getNotificationPermission`'s to
// answer, not a delivery result's. Ask for the grant first; `notify` never prompts on its own, because a prompt
// raised from a background timer is exactly the pattern browsers now punish.
//
// Auto-close is a convenience the platform lacks: `requireInteraction` aside, how long a notification lingers
// is the OS's business, and a transient one often has to be closed by hand. The timer is cancelled the moment
// the notification closes or is clicked, so a dismissed notification never leaves a pending `setTimeout`
// holding its handle alive.
