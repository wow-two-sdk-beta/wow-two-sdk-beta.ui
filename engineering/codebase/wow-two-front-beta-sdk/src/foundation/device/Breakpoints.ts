// The breakpoint model — pure, DOM-free, and deliberately WITHOUT a built-in scale.
//
// WHY NO DEFAULT SCALE: this library is Tailwind-v4 token-driven, so the app owns its breakpoints in its `@theme`
// block. A scale hardcoded here would be a second source of truth that silently disagrees with the CSS the same
// app ships — a layout that switches at 768px in JS and 720px in CSS is a bug no test in this repo could see.
// `TAILWIND_BREAKPOINTS` is offered as a constant the caller may opt into, never as a fallback a hook reaches for.
//
// Queries are plain `(min-width: …)` sorted WIDEST FIRST, so "the first query that matches" is the active
// breakpoint. Mutually-exclusive bands (`min` and `max` together) are the alternative and were rejected: bands
// need a sentinel max for the widest entry and a sub-pixel gap between neighbours (`max-width: 767.98px`), and
// both are places for an off-by-one to hide. Independent min-width queries have neither, and match how the
// mobile-first CSS beside them already cascades.
