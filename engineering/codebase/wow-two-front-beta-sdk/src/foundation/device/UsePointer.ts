// WHY NOT A USER-AGENT SNIFF: "is this a touch device" is not a device question, it is an INPUT question, and the
// two diverge constantly. A Windows laptop with a touchscreen has both a fine mouse and a coarse finger; an iPad
// with a Magic Keyboard reports a FINE pointer; a phone in desktop-site mode still has only a finger. A UA string
// describes none of that, is trivially spoofed, and is frozen or deprecated on every Chromium browser. The media
// features track the pointer the user is ACTUALLY holding and re-evaluate when it changes.
//
// WHY NOT `'ontouchstart' in window` AS THE PRIMARY SIGNAL: it proves the touch EVENT API is implemented, not that
// a touchscreen is attached — every desktop Chromium build ships the API, so the check reads true on a mouse-only
// machine and the UI grows finger-sized hit targets nobody needs. It is also a one-shot boolean with no change
// event, so it can never react to a tablet being docked to a keyboard mid-session. `(pointer: coarse)` answers the
// question that was actually being asked, and answers it reactively.

// wastes the screen. Primary is what layout should follow.
