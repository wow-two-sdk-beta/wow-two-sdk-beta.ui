// Cancellation seam — turns an `AbortSignal` into a promise rejection, for the vast majority of async work
// that has no native `signal` parameter of its own (only `fetch` and a handful of platform APIs do).
//
// THE ALREADY-ABORTED CASE IS THE ONE EVERYONE FORGETS. A signal handed in already aborted fires no `abort`
// event — the event has been and gone. Code that only calls `addEventListener` therefore waits forever on a
// signal that is *already* cancelled, which is the worst possible reading of "cancelled". Both helpers here
// check `signal.aborted` FIRST, before any listener is attached, and `withAbort` never even invokes `fn`.
//
// ABORTING DETACHES THE CALLER; IT DOES NOT CANCEL THE WORK. Nothing here can stop an already-running
// promise — that power does not exist in the promise model. The underlying operation runs to completion and
// its result is discarded. Pass the signal INTO the operation (`withAbort` hands it to `fn` for exactly
// this) whenever the operation can honour one; otherwise accept that an aborted `abortable` leaves work
// running in the background.
//
// WE ALWAYS REJECT WITH OUR OWN `AbortError`, NEVER WITH `signal.reason`, which is a deliberate deviation
// from `signal.throwIfAborted()`. `abort(reason)` accepts ANY value, so forwarding it would let an abort
// arrive as, say, a plain `Error` that `isAbortError` does not recognize — and an unrecognized abort is a
// live bug: `retryAsync` would retry a cancelled call, and `UploadQueue` would mark a cancel as a failure.
// The invariant that every consumer keys on (`isAbortError(caught) === true` for every cancellation) is
// worth more than reason pass-through, so the reason is preserved on `cause` instead of in the identity.
//
// LISTENER DISCIPLINE: every listener is `{ once: true }` (self-removing when it fires) AND explicitly
// removed on both settle paths. A signal outlives the call it cancels — one long-lived signal driving
// hundreds of short calls would otherwise accumulate a listener per call and leak every closure it holds.
