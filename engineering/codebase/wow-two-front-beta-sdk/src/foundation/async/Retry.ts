// Retry for any async function — the generic sibling of the retry loop `UploadQueue` runs over its
// transport.
//
// NO BACKOFF MATH LIVES HERE, BY RULE. `shouldRetry` decides whether to go again and `computeRetryDelay`
// sizes the wait, both from `foundation/resilience` — the same primitives `foundation/http`'s client,
// `/query`, and `uploads` already use. So a retried call in this slice backs off IDENTICALLY to every other
// retry in the app, and tuning the policy in one place moves all of them. Re-deriving exponential-with-
// jitter here would be a second, silently diverging implementation of the one thing the resilience slice
// exists to own. The only timing code below is a plain abortable `setTimeout` that waits the delay it is
// HANDED; it never computes one.
//
// `shouldRetry` IS STATUS-DRIVEN, so a caught failure is read for a numeric `status` — structurally, so an
// `ApiError` from `foundation/http`, an `UploadHttpError`, and a hand-rolled `{ status: 503 }` all
// interoperate without this slice depending on the HTTP layer. No status ⇒ `0` ⇒ transient under the
// default policy, which is the right default for the generic case: a `TypeError` from a dropped connection
// retries, a deliberate `400` does not.
//
// A CANCELLED CALL IS NEVER RETRIED. `isAbortError` short-circuits before the retry decision, plus a direct
// `signal.aborted` check for work that rejects with something else after an abort. Retrying through a
// cancel would make every cancel button a lie — the user's intent outranks the policy.
//
// Non-obvious decisions:
// - THE BACKOFF WAIT IS ABORTABLE. A 30s cap with a non-abortable sleep means a cancel is ignored for up to
//   30s; the wait resolves early on abort and the loop re-checks `signal.aborted` immediately after.
// - The rethrow goes through `toError`, which passes a real `Error` through BY IDENTITY (an `ApiError` stays
//   an `ApiError`, subclass intact) and only normalizes a non-`Error` throw. The caller is therefore
//   guaranteed an `Error` in `catch` without losing what was actually thrown.
// - `fn` receives the 1-based attempt number — enough for logging or an attempt-tagged idempotency key
//   without the caller keeping a counter alongside.
