// Rate shaping for async functions — collapse a burst into one call (`debounceAsync`), or cap a hot path to
// one call per window (`throttleAsync`). Search-as-you-type, autosave-on-keystroke, save-on-scroll.
//
// THE SUBTLE PART, AND THE REASON THESE ARE NOT THE USUAL DEBOUNCE WRAPPED IN A PROMISE: a debounced async
// call must decide what to tell the callers it SUPERSEDES. Typing "abc" produces three calls and one
// invocation, so two promises are left over. The naive implementation — keep the latest deferred, drop the
// rest — leaves those two promises PERMANENTLY UNSETTLED. That is a silent leak with no error and no log:
// every `await` on them is parked forever, holding its whole continuation (component state, closures,
// request payloads) alive for the life of the page, and `try/finally` cleanup around such an await never
// runs. In React it reads as a spinner that never stops on a request nobody can point to.
//
// So EVERY superseded caller resolves with the LATEST invocation's result. Semantically honest — a debounce
// promises "the answer as of when you stopped typing", and all three callers asked the same question, so
// they get the same answer — and it makes the promise leak structurally impossible: the waiter list is
// drained on every exit path. If a caller must distinguish its own invocation from a shared one, debounce
// is the wrong primitive; use the raw call plus an abort signal.
//
// Non-obvious decisions:
// - Both wrappers expose `cancel()`, which is what makes them safe to unmount. It clears the pending timer
//   and REJECTS parked waiters with an `AbortError` rather than leaving them hanging — the same leak in a
//   different disguise. `isAbortError` recognizes it, so an effect's cleanup path swallows it normally.
// - `debounceAsync` is TRAILING-EDGE and `throttleAsync` is LEADING-EDGE, which is the useful pairing rather
//   than a symmetry oversight: debounce answers "the user stopped, act on the final state", throttle answers
//   "act now, then ignore the flood".
// - A rejection from `fn` fans out to every waiter it represented. They were all answered by that one call,
//   so they all learn it failed.
// - `throttleAsync` shares the in-flight promise for the whole window, so suppressed callers get the leading
//   call's result rather than `undefined` — no caller has to handle a "was skipped" case that would
//   otherwise infect its return type.
