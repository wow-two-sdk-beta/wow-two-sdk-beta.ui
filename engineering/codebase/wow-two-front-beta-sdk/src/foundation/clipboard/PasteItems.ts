// Extracting a paste — the clipboard path that needs NO permission at all, and the right answer for most
// "let the user paste an image" features.
//
// WHY THIS IS THE DEFAULT AND `readText` IS NOT. When the user presses Ctrl+V they have already authorized the
// transfer; the browser hands the payload to the page on the `paste` event with no prompt, no gesture check, and
// no engine carve-outs — this works in Firefox, where `navigator.clipboard.readText` does not exist. Any feature
// framed as "the user pastes something" should be built here. Reading the clipboard directly is for the narrow
// case of looking WITHOUT a paste.
//
// EVERY READ IS GUARDED. `clipboardData` is nullable in the DOM's own types, `getData` throws in some engines
// when called outside the event's dispatch, and a synthetic event (a test double, a virtual-DOM shim) may carry
// a partial `DataTransfer`. A paste handler that throws on a malformed event breaks the user's paste entirely,
// so every access falls back to "this representation is absent".
//
// Files come from `items` first and `files` second. `DataTransferItemList` is what carries an image pasted from
// the OS screenshot tool, where `files` is sometimes empty; `files` is the reliable one for a file copied out of
// a file manager. Reading `items` first and only falling back avoids reporting the same file twice.
