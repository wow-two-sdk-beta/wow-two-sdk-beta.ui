// `useSwipe` — a flick recognizer that is deliberately NOT its own pointer implementation. It runs `useDrag` with
// a zero threshold and reads the end payload; every listener, the capture handling, the pointer-type filter, and
// the velocity window all come from there. A second listener stack would be a second set of edge cases (a pointer
// that cancels, a drag that outlives its element) resolved slightly differently, and the two recognizers would
// eventually disagree about where the same finger went.
//
// A SWIPE IS DISTANCE **AND** SPEED, both required. Distance alone promotes a slow deliberate drag into a flick,
// which is how a carousel ends up advancing when the user was carefully positioning something. Speed alone
// promotes a 3px twitch. Requiring both is what makes the gesture mean "thrown", and it is why the two thresholds
// are separate knobs rather than one blended score a consumer could not reason about.
//
// ONE DIRECTION PER GESTURE, resolved at release from the total displacement — not accumulated per move. A finger
// that arcs out and back reports where it ENDED relative to where it began, which is the thing the user meant.
