// (and the threshold math in `GestureMath`) needs these values without importing React.
//
// An axis does TWO things at once, and both matter: it gates RECOGNITION (a vertical twitch must not start an
// `axis: 'x'` drag, or a horizontal carousel steals the page's scroll) and it constrains the REPORTED delta (the
// off-axis component is zeroed, so a consumer can bind `dx` straight to a transform without re-clamping it).
