// `useLongPress` — fires once the pointer has been held still for long enough.
//
// THE DELAY IS NOT THIS SLICE'S TO INVENT. `PressExtensions.longPressDelay` already defines the `min` / `max` /
// `default` every press-driven component in the library honours, and `clampLongPressDelay` in `GestureMath` is the
// only place a requested delay meets those bounds. A second 500 here would be a second source of truth that drifts
// the first time one of them is tuned — a hold on a `Button` and a hold through this hook must mean the same thing.
//
// WHY A MOVE TOLERANCE RATHER THAN "ANY MOVEMENT CANCELS": no real touch is still. A finger resting on glass
// wanders a few pixels from tremor alone and a stylus is worse, so a zero-slack rule makes long-press fire for
// mice and almost never for the touchscreens it exists to serve. The tolerance is straight-line, not per-axis —
// a hold has no direction to be lenient about.
//
// NO POINTER CAPTURE HERE, deliberately, unlike `useDrag`. Capture exists to keep tracking a pointer that LEAVES
// the element; a hold that leaves the element is a hold that has been abandoned, and should cancel. The move and
// release listeners go on `window` precisely so that departure is observed rather than missed.
