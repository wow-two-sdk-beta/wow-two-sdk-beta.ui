// `usePinch` — two-pointer scale and rotation, the one gesture in this slice that cannot reuse `useDrag`: that
// hook is single-pointer by construction (a second `pointerdown` is ignored), and a pinch is defined by the
// RELATION between two pointers rather than by either one's path.
//
// WHY A MAP KEYED BY `pointerId`: pointer events arrive interleaved and independently — two fingers produce two
// separate `pointermove` streams that share no ordering guarantee, and either may cancel alone. Tracking "finger
// one and finger two" as variables desynchronizes the moment they arrive out of order. The map is the only
// structure that answers "where is pointer 7 right now" without caring when pointer 3 last moved.
//
// SCALE AND ROTATION ARE MEASURED FROM THE PINCH'S OWN ORIGIN, not from the previous frame. Per-frame deltas
// compound their own rounding error, so a finger returning to exactly where it started would not return the
// consumer's transform to 1.0. Anchoring both to the separation and angle captured at pinch-start means the
// gesture is always reversible.
//
// A THIRD FINGER IS TRACKED BUT NOT PROMOTED. The active pair is fixed when the pinch starts; extra pointers sit
// in the map unused. When one of the pair lifts, the pinch ENDS — and immediately re-arms on the two pointers
// still down, so a hand rolling across the surface produces clean end/start pairs instead of a transform that
// teleports as the anchors silently swap underneath it.
