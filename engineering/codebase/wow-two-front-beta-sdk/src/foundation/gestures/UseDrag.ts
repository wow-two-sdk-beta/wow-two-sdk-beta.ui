// `useDrag` — the single-pointer engine the rest of this slice is built on. `useSwipe` is a thin reading of this
// hook's end payload rather than a second recognizer, so the two can never disagree about where a pointer went.
//
// WHY POINTER EVENTS AND NOTHING ELSE: a mouse/touch pair means writing the gesture twice, then discovering the
// two disagree — touch fires a compatibility mouse sequence after every tap, `touchmove` has no capture model,
// and a stylus is a third case both miss. `PointerEvent` is one stream for mouse, touch, and pen, carries the
// device in `pointerType` (so an allowlist is a field read, not a UA sniff), and is the only one of the three with
// `setPointerCapture`. There is no legacy fallback here on purpose: every browser this library targets ships it.
//
// WHY CAPTURE **AND** WINDOW LISTENERS — the non-obvious part. `setPointerCapture` keeps the element as the event
// TARGET once the pointer wanders off it, which is what a consumer reading `event.target` expects and what stops
// another element's hit-testing from interfering mid-drag. What it does not do is survive its own absence: if the
// call fails (a stale pointer id, a test DOM without the method), events would simply stop arriving and the drag
// would freeze mid-gesture with a consumer stuck in its dragging state. So the move/up/cancel listeners are bound
// to `window` for the lifetime of the gesture — they arrive with or without capture — and capture is requested on
// top for its targeting. Belt and braces, one set of listeners, no double-fire.
//
// TOUCH NEEDS `touch-action` — the one thing a consumer must do. The browser claims a touch pointer for scrolling
// and then fires `pointercancel`, killing the drag mid-stroke. Set `touch-action: none` on the draggable element
// (or `pan-y` / `pan-x` when only one axis is yours). This slice deliberately does not write the style itself: it
// is headless, and silently blocking page scroll on a consumer's element is not a decision a hook should make.
//
// NOTHING HERE ANIMATES, so nothing here consults `useReducedMotion` — these hooks report where a pointer went,
// which is a fact, not a motion preference. A consumer that TWEENS the reported delta (spring-back, momentum,
// snap) owns that call and should read `foundation/hooks`' `useReducedMotion` at its own layer.
