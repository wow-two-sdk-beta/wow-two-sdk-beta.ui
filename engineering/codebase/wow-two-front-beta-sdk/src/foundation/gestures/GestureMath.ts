// The pure core of the gestures slice: every recognition decision — direction, velocity, scale, rotation, and each
// threshold gate — computed from plain numbers, with no DOM, no React, and no time source of its own.
//
// WHY THE MATH IS SPLIT OUT AT ALL: gesture bugs are almost never listener bugs, they are ARITHMETIC bugs — a
// diagonal that resolves to the wrong axis, a velocity that divides by a zero interval, a rotation that jumps 350°
// instead of reporting -10°. Those are exactly the cases that are miserable to reach through a synthesized pointer
// stream and trivial to pin as a table of inputs. The hooks in this slice are deliberately thin wrappers so that
// the part which can be exhaustively tested, is.
//
// TWO CONVENTIONS TO KNOW BEFORE READING ANY SIGNATURE:
//
//  - VELOCITY IS PX PER MILLISECOND, not px/s. Every duration in this slice arrives as `elapsedMs` (that is what
//    the event timeline hands over), so px/ms keeps the unit chain honest with no hidden ×1000. For calibration:
//    a deliberate flick lands near 0.5–2 px/ms, a slow drag well under 0.1.
//
//  - COORDINATES ARE SCREEN AXES. `y` grows DOWNWARD (the DOM's convention, not the maths class's), so a positive
//    `dy` is a downward move and `pointerAngle` rotates clockwise. Every function here follows the DOM rather than
//    silently flipping a sign, because the inputs come from `clientX`/`clientY` and the outputs go back to CSS.
//
// NOTHING HERE THROWS. A degenerate input — a zero elapsed time, a pinch that starts with both pointers on the
// same pixel, a non-finite coordinate from a synthetic event — returns the identity answer (0 velocity, scale 1,
// no direction) rather than an exception or a `NaN` that poisons a transform downstream. A gesture recognizer
// firing mid-interaction has no caller in a position to catch anything.

 * Velocity over the tail of a movement history, which is what "was that a flick" actually asks.
 *
 * Neither naive reading works. Measuring across the WHOLE gesture reports a fast release that followed a long
 * slow drag as slow. Measuring the LAST PAIR of samples is worse: `pointerup` repeats the final `pointermove`
 * coordinates a few milliseconds later, so a genuine flick would end at exactly zero — the single most common
 * way a swipe recognizer silently stops working. Two rules together fix both:
 *
 *  1. A TRAILING RUN OF STATIONARY SAMPLES IS TRIMMED. A sample at the same position as its predecessor carries
 *     no speed information, so measurement ends at the last point the pointer actually moved.
 *  2. UNLESS THE POINTER REALLY STOPPED. If that last moving sample is further back than the window, the trim is
 *     abandoned and the answer is zero: pressing, flicking, HOLDING, then releasing is not a flick, and rule 1
 *     alone would report the stale speed from before the hold.
 *
 * Between those, the base is the oldest sample still inside the window; when everything earlier has aged out, the
 * immediately-preceding sample is used instead, so a slow drag still reports its real (small) speed.
 *
 * @param samples Chronological history, oldest first; the last entry is treated as "now".
 * @param windowMs How far back to reach, in milliseconds.
 * @returns Signed px/ms on each axis; both `0` when fewer than two samples exist or the pointer had come to rest.
