// The engine both history flavors run on — one linear entry list plus one pointer, and every branch rule
// (truncate · evict · coalesce · group) implemented exactly once. The command flavor and the snapshot flavor
// differ only in what an entry's payload is and how two payloads merge; they must never differ in when the
// redo branch dies, so that decision lives here and nowhere else.
//
// The model is an array + an `index` cursor, not a past/future pair of stacks. `entries.slice(0, index)` is
// applied, `entries.slice(index)` is redoable. One array means truncation is `entries.length = index` — the
// single most important rule in an undo stack, expressed as one line that cannot drift between flavors.
//
// Non-obvious decisions:
// - The store is exposed through GETTERS (`canUndo`, `size`, `undoLabel`), not snapshot values. A history is a
//   long-lived mutable object a toolbar re-reads after every notification; a frozen boolean would be stale the
//   moment anything pushed. This is also why a facade must delegate getter-by-getter — a spread would evaluate
//   each one once and bake the answer in.
// - `version()` sits alongside `subscribe()` for the same reason `CommandRegistry` has one: `useSyncExternalStore`
//   re-reads its snapshot after every notification and loops forever if that snapshot has fresh identity per
//   call. The monotonic revision is the identity-stable cursor React subscribes to.
// - Coalescing anchors on the LAST PUSH, and any undo / redo / clear drops the anchor. Merging a fresh keystroke
//   into an entry the user just travelled back through would rewrite history they are currently inspecting.
// - A failed `undo` / `redo` leaves the cursor exactly where it was and reports through `onError`. A half-moved
//   pointer is worse than a failed undo: every later entry would then revert against a state that never existed.
// - `transact` flattens by depth counter rather than by nesting entries. A nested group is a caller's structural
//   detail; the user pressing ⌘Z wants the OUTERMOST intent reversed in one step, so inner labels are dropped.
// - A transaction whose body throws still commits what it buffered. The mutations already landed in the world —
//   discarding them would leave the stack unable to reverse work that actually happened.
