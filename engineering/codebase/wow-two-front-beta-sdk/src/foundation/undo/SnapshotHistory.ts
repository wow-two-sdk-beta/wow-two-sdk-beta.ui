// The snapshot-based flavor — a history of STATES rather than of work. Each entry keeps the value before a
// change and the value after it, so travelling is an assignment and there is no way for undo to disagree with do.
//
// Choose this flavor when the edited state is small and immutable — a form's values, a filter set, a colour
// picker, a small drawing model. It cannot desynchronise the way the command flavor can, and a caller writes no
// reversal logic at all. The price is memory and identity: every entry pins a whole state object, and undoing
// hands back the previous REFERENCE, so anything holding the old value keeps working while anything that mutated
// it in place has already corrupted both ends of the entry. Keep the state immutable and this flavor is the
// simpler one by a wide margin.
//
// Non-obvious decisions:
// - `record` publishes `present` immediately, then hands the before/after pair to the core. The caller has
//   already decided the new state is current; the history is a witness, not a gatekeeper.
// - Merging two adjacent snapshots keeps the OUTER pair (`previous.before` → `next.after`) and discards the
//   intermediate value. That is precisely what coalescing means for states: one undo jumps the whole run.
// - Recording the identical reference is a no-op. `setState(s => s)` is a common React shape and must not
//   deposit an entry that undoes to the value it already holds.
