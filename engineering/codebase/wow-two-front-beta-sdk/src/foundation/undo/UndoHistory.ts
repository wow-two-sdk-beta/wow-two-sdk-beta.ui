// The command-based flavor — a history of REVERSIBLE ACTIONS. Each entry pairs the work that applies a change
// with the work that reverses it, so the stack stores intent (`do` / `undo`) rather than data.
//
// Choose this flavor when the state being edited is large, shared, or lives outside React — a canvas document,
// a graph, a server-backed list. Reversing a cell edit costs one closure regardless of how big the document is,
// and the change can reach anywhere (a ref, a DOM node, a store) because nothing here inspects state at all.
// The price is that correctness is the caller's: an `undo` that does not exactly reverse its `do` silently
// desynchronises the app from its history, and nothing in this file can detect that. `SnapshotHistory` makes
// the opposite trade — see the barrel header for the side-by-side.
//
// Non-obvious decisions:
// - `push` does NOT run `do`. The overwhelmingly common shape is "the change already happened, record how to
//   take it back", so `do` exists purely to replay on redo. `execute` is the other half for callers that want
//   the history to drive the change instead.
// - Merged actions replay forward in push order and unwind in REVERSE order. Any other pairing fails as soon as
//   two coalesced edits touch the same field: undoing the first before the second restores a stale value.
