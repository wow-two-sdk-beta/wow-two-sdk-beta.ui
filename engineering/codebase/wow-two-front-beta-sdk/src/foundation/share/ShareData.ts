// The payload half of the share vector — what a caller hands in, the shape the native API actually accepts, and
// the text a share degrades to once it becomes a clipboard copy.
//
// Why a hand-rolled `ShareData` rather than the DOM lib's: ours is `readonly` end-to-end (a payload is a value,
// not a buffer the platform may edit) and carries `readonly File[]`. Neither is assignable to the DOM dictionary,
// so every native call goes through `toNativeSharePayload` to copy into the mutable shape the API demands.
//
// That copy is built key-by-key rather than spread, so the payload carries only members the caller actually set.
// `canShare` and `share` then judge the exact same object, and a member the caller left off never reaches the
// platform as a present-but-`undefined` key.
