// The item-geometry model the windowing math runs on: a prefix-sum array of cumulative start offsets, plus the
// binary search that turns a scroll offset back into an item index.
//
// WHY A PREFIX SUM AND NOT AN ARRAY OF SIZES — this is the whole reason the file exists. A virtual list answers
// exactly one question on every scroll frame: "which item is at pixel X?". Held as per-item sizes that question
// is a running total, i.e. a linear scan: O(n) per frame, and at 100k rows it is precisely the cost
// virtualization was introduced to remove. Held as CUMULATIVE offsets the array is sorted by construction, so
// the same question is a binary search over it: O(log n) — ~17 comparisons at 100k items, and flat as the list
// grows. Every read below is written against that invariant; nothing here may scan.
//
// LAYOUT: `offsets` has length `count + 1`. `offsets[i]` is item `i`'s start edge, and the extra tail entry
// `offsets[count]` is the total size. That tail is not padding — it is what makes `size(i)` = `offsets[i + 1] -
// offsets[i]` and `paddingEnd` = `total - offsets[endIndex + 1]` index-safe with no special case for the last
// item, which is where off-by-one bugs in this kind of code normally live.
//
// IMMUTABILITY: every update returns a NEW `Measurements`, and returns the SAME object when nothing actually
// changed. React consumers key work off that identity, and the no-op case is what stops a
// measure -> render -> measure feedback loop from spinning.
//
// KNOWN COST: `withMeasuredSize` shifts every later offset, so recording one measured size is O(n). That is a
// deliberate trade — measurements are rare (an item resizes) while searches are per-frame, so the cheap side is
// the one that had to be O(log n). A Fenwick/BIT would make updates O(log n) too; it is the documented upgrade
// path if a list ever re-measures thousands of rows per frame.
