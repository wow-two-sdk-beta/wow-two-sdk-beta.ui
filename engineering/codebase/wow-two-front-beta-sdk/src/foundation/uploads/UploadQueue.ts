// The scheduler — the headless core of the uploads vector. Owns admission (validate), ordering, a bounded
// concurrency pool, retry, cancellation, and progress aggregation. Framework-free (no React import) so it can be
// created at module scope, inside a provider, or in a plain node test; `UseUploadQueue.ts` is the React seam on
// top, exactly as `commands` splits `CommandRegistry` from `useCommandRegistry`.
//
// THE CONTRACT: NOTHING HERE THROWS AT THE CALLER. A transport that rejects, a transport that throws
// synchronously, a cancelled attempt, and a file rejected up front are all NORMAL OUTCOMES that land on an item's
// `status` and leave the pool running. A queue whose `add` could throw would force a try/catch around a drop
// handler, and one failing file would take down the other nine.
//
// Non-obvious decisions:
// - RETRY MATH IS NOT WRITTEN HERE. `shouldRetry` decides, `computeRetryDelay` sizes the wait, both from
//   `foundation/resilience` — the same primitives `foundation/http`'s client and `/query` use, so an upload backs
//   off identically to every other request in the app. The only timing code below is a plain abortable
//   `setTimeout`, which schedules the delay it is handed; it never computes one.
// - `shouldRetry` is status-driven, so a transport failure is read for a numeric `status`
//   (`readUploadErrorStatus`). No status ⇒ `0` ⇒ transient under the default policy: a dropped connection retries,
//   a `413` does not. That is the correct default for uploads, where the payload is unchanged by a retry.
// - A CANCELLED UPLOAD IS NEVER RETRIED. `isAbortError` (plus a direct `signal.aborted` check, for a transport
//   that rejects with something else) short-circuits before the retry decision. Retrying a cancel would make the
//   button lie.
// - An item stays `uploading` THROUGH its backoff wait, holding its concurrency slot. Freeing the slot would let
//   a queue of failing files spawn unbounded parallel waiters and defeat the cap.
// - Progress is normalized on the RATIO the transport reports, not its raw `loaded`: a multipart body is bigger
//   than the file (boundary + headers), so `loaded` alone would overshoot `file.size`.
// - `version()` exists for `useSyncExternalStore`: `items()` builds a fresh array per call, so it can never be a
//   snapshot (identity changes every render ⇒ infinite loop). The monotonic counter is the stable cursor; items
//   themselves are swapped immutably so a row can `memo` on item identity.
// - Every mutation notifies, including each progress event. A chatty transport therefore means frequent
//   listeners; throttle in YOUR listener if that matters — the queue will not silently drop state changes.
// - `patch` is a no-op for an unknown id. An in-flight upload whose item was `remove`d or `clear`ed keeps running
//   until its abort lands, and its late writes must not resurrect a deleted row.
