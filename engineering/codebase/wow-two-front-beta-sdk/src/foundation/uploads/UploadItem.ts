// The item contract — the vocabulary the queue, the hook, and any UI row all speak. Split from the queue so a
// consumer can type a prop (`item: UploadItem<MyResponse>`) without importing the store.
//
// Non-obvious decisions:
// - `status` is a const-object union, not a TS `enum` — matches `BackoffStrategy` / `CommandRunOutcome` and stays
//   erasable under `isolatedModules` + `verbatimModuleSyntax`.
// - An item is IMMUTABLE: the queue replaces the whole object on every change rather than mutating in place, so a
//   React row can `memo` on item identity and a listener can diff snapshots. Nothing here is ever written twice.
// - A file rejected up front (wrong type / too big) still becomes an item — status `failed` plus a `rejection`
//   reason. Dropping it silently would leave the user staring at a picker that "did nothing"; making it an item
//   means the same list renders the reason. `rejection` is what separates "never attempted" from "the transport
//   failed", which is why `retry()` refuses the former: a 20 MB file stays 20 MB no matter how often it is sent.
// - `attempt` counts attempts STARTED over the item's lifetime, not retries: `0` while queued, `1` on the first
//   upload, `2` after one retry. A manual `retry()` continues the count rather than resetting it, so the number
//   always answers "how many times has this file been put on the wire".
