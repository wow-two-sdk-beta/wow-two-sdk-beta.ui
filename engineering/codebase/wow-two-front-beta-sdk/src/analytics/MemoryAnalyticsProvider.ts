// The test double — a sink that ships nowhere and remembers everything.
//
// Assertions want two different views of the same traffic: "which events fired" (`events`) and "what
// happened, in order, across all three call kinds" (`calls`). Deriving one from the other at every
// assertion site is noise, so both are recorded. The arrays surface through getters typed `readonly`, so
// a test reads the live capture without being able to push into it. `flushCount` is a plain counter
// rather than a spy, so drainage can be asserted without wiring a mocking library in.
