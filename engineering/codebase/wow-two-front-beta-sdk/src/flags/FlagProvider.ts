/*
 * The backend seam: one interface a flag source implements (LaunchDarkly, Unleash, GrowthBook, a
 * `/api/flags` fetch, or the built-in `staticFlagProvider`). Everything above it — typing, defaulting,
 * targeting-context merge, React wiring — is source-agnostic.
 *
 * NOTE ON NAMING: `FlagProvider` (here) is the OpenFeature-shaped BACKEND ADAPTER. `FlagsProvider`
 * (plural, `FlagsContext.tsx`) is the React context component. Same split as the spec, which pairs a
 * provider with `<OpenFeatureProvider/>`; the plural is always the React one.
 *
 * Resolution is SYNCHRONOUS by design, unlike the spec's async provider API. A flag read happens
 * during render (`useFlag`), where an async read would force suspense or a loading flicker on every
 * gated element. So a provider holds an in-memory snapshot and resolves out of it; fetching that
 * snapshot is the adapter's own business, and `onContextChange` is the hook where a remote adapter
 * refetches after the targeting context moves.
 *
 * The four typed `resolve*` methods are typed for the CALLER's convenience only — the client
 * re-checks every resolved value at runtime, because a remote adapter's payload is untyped wire
 * data and a stale flag definition really does hand back a string for a boolean flag.
