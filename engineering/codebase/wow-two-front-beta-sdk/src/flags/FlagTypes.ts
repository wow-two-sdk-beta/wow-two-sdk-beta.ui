/*
 * OpenFeature-SHAPED vocabulary, mirrored structurally — NO `@openfeature/*` dependency, exactly
 * like `forms-engine/StandardSchema.ts` vendors the Standard Schema spec types. An app that later
 * adopts the real OpenFeature JS SDK re-points its adapter and keeps every call site: evaluation
 * context, resolution details, reason, error code and variant all carry the spec's meaning.
 *
 * Three deliberate divergences, each in service of "every evaluation is total" (see FlagClient.ts):
 *   - reasons are lowercase house strings (`'targeting'`, not the spec's `TARGETING_MATCH`), matching
 *     the `AuthStatus` / `NoticeTone` const-object shape used everywhere else in this SDK;
 *   - a MISSING flag is `reason: 'default'`, NOT an error — an unconfigured flag is the normal state
 *     during a rollout, so it carries no `errorCode` and never reaches `onError`. Only a genuine
 *     fault (wrong wire type, throwing provider) is an error;
 *   - object flags are constrained to a JSON *object* (`JsonObject`), not the spec's whole
 *     `JsonValue` — a top-level array or scalar flag is expressed as its own typed flag instead.
